# Chuck Norris API and Pokemon API

Testing and creating a simply flask web app using Chuck Norris API and Pokemon API

To run this app make sure you have the flask installed as a dependency

You can use `pip3 install flask` to install flask on your linux machine. Then use `python app.py` to start the server and copy the address or Ctrl+Left Click on the url to open the webpage.

Go to the endpoints to see the web app working and using simple GET requests to render the content.

`/pokemon`endpoint goes to the page with shows random pokemons and their pictures

`/ `endpoint goes to the home which shows a random joke about chuck norris

Folder structure:

`/static` This folder has all the static `.css` files that the webpage uses.

`/templates` This folder contains all the`.html` files that are used as a template by flask to render content to the browser.

`app.py` has the basic backend code written in python using the flask framework to do the same.
