# TO-Do List

Testing and creating a simply flask web app by using a database sqlite using the ORM sqlalchemy.

To run this app make sure you have the flask installed as a dependency

You can use `pip3 install flask` to install flask on your linux machine and `pip3 install sqlalchemy` to install SQLAlchemy. Then use `python app.py` to start the server and copy the address or Ctrl+Left Click on the url to open the webpage.

Go to the endpoints to see the web app working and using simple GET requests to render the content.

`/ `endpoint goes to the home which shows an empty list of tasks

`/update` to update the items but after updating the task in the database it redirects to `/`

`/delete` to delete the items but after deleting the task from the database it redirects to `/`

Folder structure:

`/static` This folder has all the static `.css` files that the webpage uses.

`/templates` This folder contains all the`.html` files that are used as a template by flask to render content to the browser.

`app.py` has the basic backend code written in python using the flask framework to do the same.

`test.db` is the database file generated by sqlalchemy Object Relational Mapper. To create it manually we can use the following commands from the python shell.

Type the following to open by the python shell

```
python3
```

Then use 

```python
from app import db
db.create_all()
```

This will automatically create the database file in the directory and then we can run our flask app.
