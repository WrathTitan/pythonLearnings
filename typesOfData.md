# Types of Data

With regards to machine learning models

* Numerical Data
* Categorical Data
* Time Series Data
* Textual Data
* Tabular Data
* Images
* Audio
* Video

## Numerical

* Continuous - Floating point numbers, exponentials etc
* Discreet - only integers
* Used in many ML applications

## Categorical

* Categories given to the data but it does not have any mathematical value or significance
* Significance can be given to it when we assign some value to each of the categories.
* Used in classification tasks

## Time Series 
* Sequence of numbers collected at regular intervals over some period of time
* Used in trading bots, finance, stock markets, etc.

## Text
* Words, sentences, etc
* Used in Natural Language Processing

## Tabular

* Data is arranged in rows and columns.
* Each row represents the training example and the column represents its features and label.
* Used in many ML applications

## Image

* A 2 dimensional image represents pixels each of which has a value and based on the colour scheme or encoding turns out to have multiple dimensions. Ex: A 20X20 px RGB image turns out to have 20X20X3 dimensions 
* Used in Convolutional Neural Networks

## Audio

* Audio is a signal taking on continuous values.
* Used in Speech Recognition, Voice Assistants etc.

## Video

* Used in real time object detection.
* Basically images/frames are taken an CNN is done on it for the required task.
* Can be thought of as an extension to Images but with Audio added
* Used in Video Surveillance, Object Detection and classification, self driving cars, etc.
