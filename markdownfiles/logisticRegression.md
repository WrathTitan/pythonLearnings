# Logistic Regression

* Logistic regression is a classification algorithm. It is used to predict a binary outcome based on a set of independent variables.
* Logistic Regression is a supervised learning algorithm that is used when the target variable is categorical

Logistic regression is a classification algorithm used to assign observations to a discrete set of classes. Unlike linear regression which outputs continuous number values, logistic regression transforms its output using the logistic sigmoid function to return a probability value which can then be mapped to two or more discrete classes.



Types of logistic regression:

* Binary (Pass/Fail)
* Multi (Cats, Dogs, Sheep)
* Ordinal (Low, Medium, High)

### Model Explainability:

* Model works, but why does it work?
* Explain using the dataset and its features

### Feature Importance calculation:

* `clf.coef_` This outputs values for each column and how important is it with respect to the model

### Feature Visualisation:

* Different trends can be explained in the dataset by visualising the data
* Helps identify the relationship
