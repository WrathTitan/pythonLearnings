324,When will I ever do something right?,"I just made toast for my grandmother and she complained how I didn't do it right and how one of these days this 'house's will get something right.

Just last week I was writing my suicide note. Iwas crying to myself of why god had to take my mum away when everyone liked her and I am just the opposite.

My aunt told me the stuff I did last year when my grandfather took a heart attack was not good enough such as failing my course due to taking days off and not being able to do my work ,picking up my cousin from school which meant taking days off and cleaning before picking her up,restless days and sleepless nights and it was just not enough. She also told me sarcastically I have had such a hard life.

I just feel like I should of died not my mum.

I was talking to my brother and mid sentence I bursted into tears and he just stared at me.I had to sooth myself. I am feeling so lost right now.

I love my mum but lately I am starting to hate her due to everyone making me feel guilty for not being  as helpful or caring as she was.",1
325,Deal to end my life.,"I'm a good student. Very passionate, very serious when it comes to my studies. I went through a very hard scholarship and I managed it. Yet i now have to change of university to continue my studies. Basically I'm supposed to have my place there automatically, but with the covid 19 crisis the french educational system fucked up badly badly, so I'm left stranded without any informations related with my registration there. I have a very shitty life, I am at a very bad place right now. With some positive sides, but there are more negative ones. My only way out is to pursue my studies. If for some reasons I wasn't accepted to the university, or was accepted but asked to work from home, I'll end my life. I keep holding onto my responsibilities. I don't think about myself first. Probably why I'm still alive. I'm fighting my everyday struggles and my shitty depression for other people's sake mostly. But if I had to be caged, I'll think of myself at last and choose death. I refuse to be kept away anymore. Family life feels like a kidnapping. I might be an adult but the further I can go is where I throw the trashes. No friends to visit me, I am not able to visit friends. Stuck in the middle of the countryside, I love the view but it feels like prison when being isolated there for months and months. I just want to live my own life at times. I just want to be able to choose for myself. To choose to go to a park. To a shop. To a coffee... I'm not going to accept staying there an extra year. And my only way out is studies. Otherwise they'll not allow me to go anywhere and I won't allow myself to disobey. I want to go a peaceful way. Not within humiliation and violence.",1

there are hundreds of solutions that I can apply, being eighteen and all. but due to this pandemic, it's harder to get out even with that little courage you had previously when it was apparently okay. or maybe I'm just making excuses. 

im doing anything in my power to keep my mind at peace but there's not a moment everyday where I'm meant to feel like I'm responsible for half of the things wrong in the world. 

friends? let's not get into that. I wouldn't be writing this on here, expecting strangers to read as they scroll by, if I had friends. but my problem lies within me. im so mentally exhausted, that talking to people, even when they tell me they're there, makes me feel absolutely useless.

I tired of struggling through life alone and seeing how much my parents hate me. But values my brother. I'm tired of my dad telling me he has no money to help me and I have to pay for my own college tuition, new phones and everything else. While he buys my younger brother a car, new phones LIKE MULTIPLE PHONES and pays for his college tuition. WHERE THE FK DOES THAT MONEY COME FROM!?

Then gaslights me and tells me he treats us the same whenever I bring it up. He tells me I'm spoiled and he doesn't know how to treat me better. He gives me food and a roof over my head. That's fine and all if he wasn't also buying my brother a shit ton of other stuff then telling me I should get a job and work for it if I want it. FK HIM AND HE CAN GO TO FKING HELL.

Ever since I was a kid it was like this. If I was doing well he'll tell me it's because my brother is worse at everything and needs the extra help. If I'm doing poorly he'll tell me figure it out myself, and continue to only help my brother with everything he needs. FK HIM FK HIM FK HIM.

I just feel like I don't deserve their time and I'm scared the could find out about my past. This is like the 5 time I'm writing this because I keep deleting it afterwards but I need to finally tell someone. When I was twelve I tried to kill myself with a bottle of pills. When people asked me why I would just make up a fake story about my cat running away, but the true reason is just nothing I could ever tell someone I know, or thet knows me. I was raped when I was 11. I never told anybody except for my cats. I'm to embarrassed and I feel like I will get blamed. I was a naive and stupid kid, way to weak. If I had had the strength to just beat him and run away none of this would have ever happened in the first place. I was stupid for being out late and stupid for being alone. And now I'm even too stupid to just accept what happened. I can't change it so I don't have the right to feel sad about it whole other kids still go through the same pain everyday. And if I didn't spend so much time sulking over it then maybe I would still have friends. But then again I shouldn't complain..I still have my beloved mother and I shouldn't complain about not having more. I know that I am loved, but that makes it even worse .. if everybody hated me I could just die in piece but at this rate, I woukd make my Mother cry and my service dog would be lonely and my cats would panick. Yet knowing that doesnt make me want to live. I don't wanna live yet I don't wanna die. I just wanna nonexistent or atleast unloved.

341,I hate my mom. She ruined my life and I am planning to end it.,"I am 13 years old and I've been thinking of ending it all together by jumping off a bridge nearby. My death would be instant and I probably wouldn't feel pain because of the fast impact. I am a student who never got a failing grade or a low grade. My teachers praise me for always doing great on tests. I do not say bad words nor do I do anything mean. I really like technology and gaming altogether however my mom doesn't like it and she thinks of it as some sort of like worshipping the devil. She is really religious and she really likes God and anything holy. She is 40 years old and she is a boomer Karen and believes anything on the internet. She says she loves me but I don't feel like it. She typically blames everything on me and if I try to rebel she would just constantly should at me. She doesn't like it when something does not go her way. My dad knows about this but my dad can't do anything. My dad is working in another country and I really like my dad. My dad is hardworking and he is an engineer so he understands what I do. My mom is selfish and she gets anything she wants just by asking my dad and if he doesn't get it she will become furious and shout at me. She works at a bank as a manager (yes, a boomer Karen who is a manager). I and mom often fight because of simple things like the printer ink is empty and she would tell me to force it to print and etc. My suicidal thoughts first started in fourth grade when she shouted at me and called me a ""liar"". Something I never expected for her to say. I went to school that day and I was just really sad. When I arrived at home and went to bed she told me about how I felt and that she would constantly force me to ""forgive"" her which I did not. This then became ""our"" secret and if I told dad she would shout at me again. A few years later and many fights later and my dad still does not know about this and our constant fighting. My dad is a simp and he loves her all his heart. He would never leave her unless he hears about what she does to me. Whatever I do right or wrong is wrong and that anything that my mom does is right. I have OCD and I really like keeping things really clean and neat. However, my mom likes the opposite. She messes up my table and takes whatever she wants from me or if I don't something bad will happen. Some of my friends in school hate me for no reason but that is another story for another subreddit. I am tired typing all of this I want to see if anybody out there cares about some guy on the internet thinking about killing himself. This might be my last post. I don't want to see hate in the comments. Again I need help.",1
342,A mental health professional who cannot benefit from mental health professional help,"Debate
I like debating.  There’s a rush, a thrill to using logic and reason to being able to have your point upheld without question of its validity by yourself and your peers.  I stand to reason that, through logic and reason, I could be wrong in my assessment of my situation.

I’ve been working in the mental health profession for almost 15 years.  I have talked more people out of suicide and going down the dark alleys of regret and heartache than I can count.  Besides a small handful of cases, I’ve succeeded on these counts and I take my duty to this world, and for me, my God, seriously. I was meant to do this job.

I have had my bouts of suicide in the past long ago.  I’ve been hospitalized for it as well.  I have had a previous diagnosis of bipolar disorder. It was treated for many years however, with the help of psychiatrist, therapy, and prayed, I was able to be taken off my medication - utilizing coping skills, understanding of my triggers (in particular my mania triggers), and a strong support system of family (my parents and siblings) and church.

I’ve been married for nearly a decade now. I have three children with fairly big age ranges.  I can’t get into too much detail because this is a throwaway account for obvious reasons. I’m also looked at a leader in my field: I’m a director of a psychiatric facility.  I have a post graduate degree and am currently working towards my doctorates; however, that is on pause at the moment due to my commitment to my facility during this pandemic.

Despite the degree of respect and hospitality I receive in my field; my home life is another story.  I am the sole provider yet expected to still ensure food is cooked (I either cook or I waste money on fast food), the kids are being taken cared of, house is maintained to a certain degree, bills are paid, etc etc etc.  I have little to no respect from my wife, and to agree my own children.  I am not allowed to listen to certain music or watch certain shows or movies without a degree of criticism from my wife who assumes if I have time for those things I should either do something around the house, spend time with her, or spend time with the children so that she can play video games or watches whatever she wants to.  She watches whatever she wants to be my selection of music and movies are questioned. If I’m in a seclusive mood, my entrainment selections are to be blamed for bringing in “bad spirits”.  Or I’m bringing in “bad spirits” from work and not praying or reading the Bible enough.

I’ve tried to leave my wife recently.  I had a glimpse of a life I could have had: I had a nice apartment ready for me, friend and family who have essentially kept at a long distance embraced me and told me that they would be there for me, I pictured being able to care of my children without arguments in the house, with structure, with the upbringing of family meals, chores and a clean home, and activities together that I know they will enjoy in an environment where the mood of the house is not fixed upon the mood of a single person.  This was only a glimpse and this world came crashing down.

Without her working, it would appear that almost 60-70% of my income would go to her - even with the children custody being 50/50.  This according to her lawyer (my lawyer I had vetted appeared to just tell me whatever it took for me to drop the money for the huge retainer).  I would essentially be working for her and barely be able to live in my apartment, which I didn’t mind at first but the cost kept increasing and my available funds kept decreasing.  Then the schools closed for fall making the lives of my children more strained and uncertain.  Both her and myself would need to move into small apartments and it would be hard on my children taking on so many changes in such a short time.  

So we decided to have me move back in (I was staying with a friend) and we would work it out.  I was seeing a pastor about the issue who advised me to fight for my marriage.  I set terms of what I felt would be fair for this marriage and our roles in the household.  I said I think we should sleep in the same room (I’ve been on the couch since January), she should help pay the bills, help with groceries, and help put dinner on the table.  Chores should be divided in the household to everyone to help relieve the burden.  We should communicate and talk more. I wanted a marriage therapist (as I’ve always wanted one) but it didn’t seem like that demand would be acquiesced.

Any slight I make, any time I disagree with her decision or her views (her views are 5G towers are evil, vaccines are bad, Trump is good, coronavirus is blown out of proportion for the new world order, money-less society is for the new world order, etc.) then I’m not praying enough and am being too worldly.  (All her views, by the way, are the opposite of mine).

Last week her nephew had a birthday party (they live in my house so this was okay with the pandemic).  She screamed at me for forgetting the rice and beans from the store. She didn’t like how I looked when she screamed at me about it. Throughout the day, she was mad, apologized, mad again, apologized, etc. etc. etc.  There’s no point in analyzing her behaviors because she will refuse to get any treatment anyways, even if she agrees with certain things (like having PMDD, she only wants natural remedies which she doesn’t stick with).

Something occurred to me that day, I made up my mind to commit suicide.  I’ve thought about all the ways I could reason myself out of it but no argument held up:

1. It’s selfish - so is being forced to live ONLY in the service of others.
2. My children - this is a good reason NOT to commit suicide but the fights they see, the look of defeat on my face has got to be damaging as well. I lost my father at an early age and it hurt during that period but was able to still achieve what I’ve been able to.
3. My family - my mother will be devastated, yes, as will my brothers who have their own mental health issues themselves (but are doing very well in their own fields).  I hope that knowing I’m not suffering anymore of feeling inadequate, lost, pitiful, and depressed can be a consolation of sorts.
4. My salvation - I’ve already begun praying everyday for God to forgive me for these thoughts and what I’m planning on doing.

Now; the number one reason I haven’t killed myself yet is a big one: pain.  I don’t want to feel pain.  The reason I don’t want to feel pain is because I don’t want to change my mind at the last minute and then suffer from disfigurement or brain damage. I want to start it and finish it.  I’ve had one, what I would consider, real suicide attempt already in my life. I know, statistically speaking, the next one has a greater chance of success and the subsequent one does not.  So I need to make sure the method I do is going to fulfill my desires in this endeavor: painless, somewhat quick without the chance of having my mind changed, and a high degree of lethality.

I know the science behind the methods. I know that my body can even unconsciously fight off any attempts at ending my life.  I don’t own a gun yet so I cannot use that method. Hanging is my preferred method and I’m still doing research on the TOR network of ways to make it painless with different drug cocktails, etc.

Before I die I also want to make a journal writing the way I wish my life was: a sort of way to life my life without having to wait and live it or the obstacles I’m currently experiencing.  I love to write.  Before I got into the medical field, it was what I wanted to do the most.  I figure I can write about life that I wanted to suffice my cravings for what could have been.

In the end, I don’t know what to do with how I’m feeling.  I’m positive for Covid-19 and have been suffering from chest pains.  I was positive after I made the final decision to see to it that I end my life. I was hoping this would lead to my death instead.  I have been downplaying the effects of the virus in hopes that without medical attention I can die in my sleep. I’m already taking the proper precautions at home to protect my family.  I’m also passed the suicide clause of my life insurance so my children should qualify for a handsome payout.  Also the SSI checks they should receive on top of that should help as well along with anything else my wife will qualify for, she can sustain this lifestyle they have for at least 2-3 years which is plenty of time before she finishes nursing school and gets a job.

I tried to see a therapist but couldn’t find any in this pandemic climate that takes my insurance, and, quite frankly, it’ll be a waste. I know what they will say. I know the tricks of the trade and how to navigate the misguided  “rationalizations” of suicide.  I know that theirs light at the end of the tunnel.  I know that leaving my wife would make all of this better.  But it comes at too great of a cost; not to mention the times she said she would call my work, embarrass me, and try to get my license taken away at all costs.  So what life is there for me? I’ve alienated my friends and family by going back to her - whom she wants me to have as little contact with as possible due to their support of our divorce earlier.  I would lose my job, my career, my calling.  I would essentially be working for her and if I lost my job I wouldn’t be making enough.  My kids already think very little of me for not sticking up for myself in my house but it’s hard when you’re up against someone who is willing to play chicken with a tank; who’s willing to see everything burn and not flinch.  How do you compete against that?

If this virus doesn’t kill me, I’m going to have difficult time finishing the job but I won’t give up.  She’s always saying I always leave things unfinished.  This is one job I want to complete.

Sorry for the long read... I said I liked to write.",1
343,no one will tell me how paracetamol kills you,"‘get help now’ no i won’t get help now, why do i owe anyone or anything to not go through with it? why? it makes no sense, just fucking let me what the fuck i’m so upset no one will tell me some things say you go into a coma other that it can take weeks and i just want to know for sure how it would happen",1
344,I see no reason to carry on anymore,"Sounds dramatic but it's true. I'm in my 30s, unemployed with little prospects due to leaving school before completing it (I have no qualifications basically) both my parents died before I reached adulthood so I've lived as pretty much an orphan for half my life. It's been years since I've been in a relationship and I can't see that changing any time soon (I've got attachment and emotional problems funnily enough) and I'm a recovering addict. I'm a real winner right?

I do have siblings but they have their own problems and I'll never tell them how I feel. They don't even know I was an addict so that's not an option. Plus the damage me telling them what's going on with me could make their own mental health problems worse which I couldn't live with in all honesty.

I just lie in bed all day and have no interest in anything. If I cared about myself at all I'd have been to the doctors to get help but I don't. I mean even if they give me anti depressants or therapy that won't change the fact my life is going nowhere and that no one really cares about me. Pills and talking can't fix me or I'd have tried it. I don't think I'll ever be okay with having no parents, no one to call when life gets tough.

All I want to do is pack up or throw out all of my things so there's less for whoever has to deal with the aftermath and then die. But I'm so depressed I can't even do that so most likely I'll end up leaving them a mess for which I'll be sorry for.

I don't know why I'm writing this. I guess I just needed to let it out before I do the inevitable. I'm giving myself until January and then doing it unless the urge makes me do it sooner. Hopefully by then there'll be less for others to deal with. I've already made sure I've created more distance between myself and the few people who slightly care about me so it'll hurt less.

349,I fucking hate myself so much,"Two years ago I broke up with my ex because I realized that she wanted more from me than I could deliver. I was a heavy smoker of cigarettes and spliffs, lived on a poor diet, didn't accomplish anything in my life yet. She was 34 and I was 26. It was destined to fail. I ended things too abruptly and it wasn't nice how I did it, but I did it with good intentions.

I quit my smoking, I started hitting the gym 6 times per week, I gained 20 kilo, I meditate, I changed so much. Became a much better person. I was starting to feel such intense regrets about my past. Should have always lived like this. I got obsessive thoughts about dying soon.

So when COVID-19 started, I wanted to have a good conversation with my ex about this. I was being overly dramatic and convinced that I would die soon and also told her that I regretted our break-up. For her it was just like 'ugh what does this guy want from me' she repeatedly told me to stop contacting, but she kept saying triggering shit like 'you didn't change a bit' so I kept going. In the end she exploded. Told me I will 'never learn how to live my life' and called me 'tragic, whining, fickle loser king' and that she 'doesn't fucking care if I die'

I was already at my lowest, I already feel so bad about myself, I already hate my past self so much. I think I'm going to die young. And then she says this.. This shit kept repeating in my head everyday for 6 months. It makes me want to jump off a cliff because I already feel like such a failure and to then have those horrible insults repeating in my obsessive brain is the worst :(",1

Maybe you don’t have any control over whether things can get better for you, I don’t know. But you still can’t definitively say that things will continue to be worse. Maybe they will, maybe they won’t. Maybe an opportunity to be happy will slap you in the face, or you have to work your butt off to find it or maybe it just never comes. So, yeah. Both sides.",0

I barely knew this girl and was from tinder but it was going well and we even almost kissed. It was one of the only actually good nights I’ve had in a long long time. I don’t go out anywhere. All my friends moved away.

I know it’s not a big deal to lose the girl but for some reason it hurt like hell when she wanted to be taken home by police instead of me. 

I didn’t do anything wrong. We got pulled over because we were playing Pokémon GO together. The officer pulled me over and asked me what I was doing and then said he smelled marijuana and it was all over from there. No jail thank god, but fucking still. I don’t deserve this. I’m not a criminal. I try so so hard to keep other people’s feelings considered and to feel special. I go out of my way to do that because I don’t want anyone to feel the same kind of pain that I feel.

I don’t know about you guys but I think it’s time for me to go. The world is not very bright right now, and nothing goes right for me. It’s always one after the other something extremely disappointing happens to me and even after everything it’s not enough. I’ll never be enough. I’m getting ahead of myself. I can’t believe I just did this. I’m so fucking embarrassing. Please just make it stop. Just make it stop, that’s all I want. I don’t want to hurt anyone. I just want to help people.",1

360,Past is always hostile,"All of my happy memories from past are now became seeds of agony

It is raining outside. my dead lover loved the sound of raindrops. and it is painful to remember that.

everything will become trigger to painful thoughts time after time.

even when i see something, Anything. like pizza, i imminently think about my dead lover because it was her favourite. 

and It is not all about my dead lover. all of my memories are painful to remember. the bones of memories were became seeds of agony.

my younger days, from little tiny kid to teen, early stage of adult. the memories, even the happiest memories bring me sadness. and there are not a lot of happy memories to begin with. which make things even worse.

all of my past is tormenting me and i have learned everything will be become things of past. even if there is some bright future awaits for me, that will also fall into realm of past.

Past is Hostile to me. and everything will become past.

the only way to end this loop of pain is end my present to make future to not happen. 

Only thing that holding my back is my empathy towards those who will left alive after my death.

i experienced the wave of emotions a person need to bear after someone whom they loved dies. and that makes me alive.

but i'm already a dead man to me. it is mear case that is alive. i hope painless, quick and unexpected death is wating for me. 

for those who will leftover.",1
361,6 months untill my suicide handgun arrives . (The timing will be perfect as then i will be well past my 18th birthday so no one will be able to take the gun away from me and I'll finish high school just then),"Well this is.the end of the road huh? What a life it was....some life. Do you think i wanted to do this? Do you think I've dreamt of dying like this in a million years?  I didn't want to do this. You people(the people I am forced to seroundd  myself with) have made my life so insufferable, so  depressing . You've made me so aggressive  by mocking me for the smallest thing i liked, for my wight which made me lose 35 kg when i was 13 and actually stop being fat. You mocked me for having black  and gay friends (calling them racial slurs proving you're racist as fuck) made fun of me for having a girlfriend who's 5 years older then me calling me ""way too hideous to have a girlfriend"" making me almost insecure. You would also physically attack me knowing that the authorities wouldn't bother you cause you're parents were some well respected business people so you could get away with anything and I would actually get in trouble for fighting back

You would attack me knowing damn well i was stronger then you and that i could and would bash your skull in with a club if laws weren't  inforced that prevented me from protecting myself 

To my parents : you were both VERY racist (typical for my town) and were both sexist against both men and women. Dad you would not let mom work saying she should stays in the kitchen (typical  1980's sexism) even though you were an aggressive alcoholic who spent thousands of dollars a year on alcohol you wouldn't let me buy video games to distract myself from you two's arguments. I always had to listen to your arguing and fights. You always managed to drag me in them for the mildest issue and verbally assoult me and threaten physical assoult. Every day,every birthday you 2 were there ruining everything


To mom: you were the typical  21st century feminist hypocritical, mysandrist , lazy (so lazy you were too fucking lazy to reach your arm for something) you two would get on my nerve so much  and say ""You're too young to be stressed out"" Bitch fuck you . You're part of the reason I'm so aggressive and depressed.  You were a Karen garbage person. You pretended to have knowledge of subjects you know nothing about like vaxines,mental health and my liking towards firearms. What do you know about mental health? You were a frat girl interested in nothing more then boyfriends, spending way too much money   and dropping out of high school.  That would be fine if you didn't try to teach me your bullshit morals  that held 0 value due the fact that you were a very negative person preaching about positivity.




You thought I would be ok with living in a 100 year old house that's starting to fall apart and the fact that there's mice everywhere. Fuck that home Id rather spend a year inside of a concentration camp instead of having to go near that house. 


And worst part is when i went to use mental health therapy via a psychiatrist you told me (don't say anything upsetting to the psychiatrist cause then you'll be put on mental health pills and we won't be able to afford them"" 

Yep you told me not to discuss my mental health...  WITH A PSYCHIATRIST THAT'S MENT TO HELP ME WITH MY MENTAL HEALTH!
Most of you people who saroundd me are the reason I'm so depressed, want to kill myself and will kill myself (maybe) and have wanted to kill you all via  a  shooting for a long time .   Work sucks, high school sucks, home sucks...life just sucks what more is there to say?",1

My dad left me in an amazing place financially for someone my age, i own the property I live in and have savings over six figures but none of it means anything to me right now.

This is a long post & I hope you take the time to read this. I need help. 

I think I’m a very rational person. I understand the impact of suicide and how it will affect those who are connected to me. 

But, I am not feeling myself. I honestly believe I have peaked as a human. I hope writing this out to a community of strangers, may help find me some relief in the constant tightness I feel in my chest. Maybe there is someone out there who can relate with what I’m going through. 

Since I’ve hit my 30s, my life is starting to reflect my mistakes. Yesterday I’ve moved back in with my parents. 

There are no pictures of me of the last 6 years of my life. I lost a lot of confidence in myself. As a 32 year old female, I starting balding. I can see my scalp more and more each day. Even taking my showers makes me depressed. As I run my fingers through my hair, it just doesn’t stop falling out. I don’t want to go out anymore. I don’t want to be in the sun without a hat. My hair loss has definitely wrecked my confidence. 

I’m trying to take my depression into my own hands. I exercise about 4-5 days a week. I can see a positive change in my body (even friends who haven’t see me in awhile can tell). But at the end of the day, I just don’t want to be alive anymore. I feel like I don’t have anything to offer. I recklessly put myself in debt. Which has hindered my ability to buy a home of my own. I watch my friends buy their first homes and share their lives with their significant others. 

I have put up such a wall around myself. I haven’t dated or had sex with anyone in over 5 years. I tell myself I’m okay with being by myself. But there is always going to be a emptiness. 

This may sound weird, but I’m oddly okay with wanting to end my life. It’s just how it will affect my family and friends that is keeping here. They will heal over time... but I can’t put the fast forward button on that. 

I’m just tired of feeling this way. Tired of crying. Tired of being me. 

I am not religious. But I’m have tried looking for some sort of guidance through God. It has not been what I thought it would be. Would God speak to me? Would the tightness in my chest be lifted once I accepted God into my life?

What else can I do?",1

I was 10 years old and living happy and when I would visit my family friend who ran a small little daycare where she would take care of kids for almost nothing, there was this one girl who was my age and she would stay there for almost the whole day. It was because her mother was an drug addict and would leave her there and forget about her. After my family friend closed the daycare when she got sick, I never saw the girl. Almost 6 years later, I was talking to my coworker (son of family friend) and asked him if he had ever saw her again after they closed The daycare. He said no and he said it's likely that she's still living with her mom or is in foster care. It sort of made me upset because here I am, living a good life and there's another person like me somewhere out there living with bad foster parents or a traumatizing childhood like that.",1

I miss when I was social and had so many people loving me, and now I'm left with no one. Seeing anyone has texted me would make my day, which happens rarely and now no one wants to talk to me.

My leg is damaged and wont heal, I can't really work I'm in pain all the time, I have other disabilities on top of that, I've never had anyone love me back yet I want that more then anything in the world, but I just sit by and see others enjoy what I can't have. I don't know how to feel. I sleep a ton and sleep so much of my life away, I was thinking a bit ago why does it seem like the years go by so much quicker, and then I realized I'm sleeping like 9 at the low and regularly 14 hours a day. And adding that up over time there are literal months just missing from my life each year. When I got really depressed and anxious a few years ago I pushed just about everyone out of my life. I don't feel like anyone will care, and no one new is ever going to enter my life it feels like. I'm just so tired of being alone, nothing helps it, when you know people don't really want you and they just tolerate you, what use is it to be around them they make me feel even more lonely. I wish I knew what to do with my life. I just feel like there is no hope going forward, I'm broken in so many ways. I feel like I'm already dead and things are just being dragged out to the inevitable. So many of my dreams have been crushed. I don't even know if I'll ever be able to be self sufficient and it all feels like a fantasy.

I'm also relatively young mid 20's and I just see everyone moving on to bigger and better things in their lives getting better paying jobs, getting degree's, getting married, raising families. And I'm falling further and further behind. Part of me is struggling and straining to kick myself in gear before it's to late and the other part is just... It's to hard, I'm so broken, I don't have that sort of fight in me anymore, I have nothing to fight for, no help, no love, just all alone... and I just can't. But I feel like my chance is slipping away. I don't know what to do and I feel so trapped. And being so poor for so long is just so hard and so draining. and every dollar to earn for me is so painful and so hard. I'll never be able to have much. I wasted all my savings before on doctors that didn't help, and I just can't earn that sort of money to even try and fix things, and many people I've spoken to it seems like it just made it worse for them. My only options now are painful work I don't know if I can bare or death. And I don't know what to do. I can't do this alone, I just want to cry. 

I just feel like I've been cursed. And my life just gets worse and worse.",1

They're expired so it'd probably be pointless but I still sat and counted and  hit the exact number and had none left in the bottle.

413,"One bad thing after another, my life just doesn’t feel real anymore...","Im 20 years old and despite dealing with mental health issues for most of my life, I have finally reached breaking point.

The sad thing is, I used to have things going for me but its just been one setback after the next.
Parents seperated at age 9 which is obviously common but looking back has affected my life a lot. It was the first thing that made me realise life wasn’t fair and bad things do just happen.

Anyways, my teenage years were full of anxiety and depression as I was late to develop compared to everyone else. This really affected my confidence and my education in general. I went from being quite a popular and active kid to someone no one gave a shit about.

My confidence started to come back when I did finally start to grow up a bit. My life improved for a year or so. I had great friends, went out partying and just generally enjoyed life.

This was when I was sixteen. It went downhill again. The depression and anxiety all came back and as a reult my life suffered. I lost a family member in 2017, I was in a really toxic relationship and I failed at school.  By summer 2018, I thought what is the point in all of this when Im just unhappy all the time, even when things are going well they eventually go to shit.

So after that I really started isolating from the world. I worked a shitty retail job and eventually had my hours reduced so I just ended up staying at home by myself a lot of the time. I didnt want to go out as I just felt so uncomfortable. So i ended up losing contact with most of my friends.

Last year I decided i needed to change so I started studying to go to uni. You know, to give my life some purpose. I quite my shitty job and focused on that. So up untill March, I was pretty much staying home all the time and studying in an attempt to pass my course and start fresh at uni.

I was still stressed and had low mood cause I stayed by myself so much and I was still in a rut but I thought passing this course would give me a new start.

Then Covid happened.

Despite only being 20, the months of staying by myself, being stressed and not staying healthy had clearly lowered my immune system.  So much so that I caught the virus and I have been suffering with it ever since March.

I just didn’t think it could get worse but it has. In fact, this illness has made me want my old life back so much. You never know what you have until its gone. 

I just feel so shit. Physically and mentally. At least before I could hide away and keep myself to myself, now I have no safety net as my health is at risk.

When news of covid was first picking up I thought finally isolating from the world and being a lonely introvert would pay off but in the end it’s backfired. Im the only person I know thats even suffered with the disease.

I dont want to die. I want to live. But i dont want to live like this. Why? Why the fuck is this happening?",1
414,I cant tell if people are being genuine or ironically nice to me,Im such an idiot loser I should just jump off a tall building. My personality is so bad and no boy/girl would even have a single dopamine molecule go through thier brain when thinking about me to even have the thought of being in a relationship. Im so stupid and useless all i do is take away from others lives. Im such an awful disgusting person. I hate being alive its so boring every experience sucks and its very unstimulating. I think thats the number one question ive had since i was born. Why is life extremely boring? Id rather die just so i can go meet ghosts or something. Life is such a boring and silly game that everyone takes so seriously that they think you shouldnt dare think about pressing quit and playing something else. I dont know where my trauma and depression comes from but i do feel an intense craving to be held by someone else and feel 100 percent accepted and loved in thier arms. Everything is my fault apparently some people say you shouldnt play the victim of circumstance in life others say its acceptable. If i had to pick something to blame it would be my own mind always sabotaging me all the time. When i was a kid that never happened and i operated the way i wanted to. But now things changed for some reason and it doesnt cooperate. Idk what im saying at this point all i know right now is im possibly on a mission to kill myself,1

There must have been a point in time when I felt sympathy for her, but I feel utter apathy after listening to it for so many years.

After my first suicide attempt the place they took me to made us have family therapy in which she was told how much her drinking effects me. Not even a month later she returned to it only worse then before.

I didn't consent to be born. Why do the parents get to make the decision? Isn't life supposed to be about the choices that you make? If I did consent, why? What kind of lie was I believing? That life would be kind? Truthful?

People use me. They use me for my smarts, my almost zero amount of looks (I dont look good but people still want to frick me. Why?), the fact that I'm underage, and that I'm a woman. 

I feel like Im just a placeholder. That layer of buttercream in between the layers of cake. The useless cardboard packaging in a phone box.

I've always been lesser. My sister has always been skinnier, smarter, more good-looking, happier, and kinder. She's always seeing the bright side of things. How? Why? Why does she care if someone scrapes their knee? Someone she doesn't even know? 

I respect elderly people. All the shit they've been through, the loss of their loved ones, and the crap they get just because they've lived this long. 

God, I wanna die young. I'd be happy if I was stillborn. Another miscarriage my mother had. If only that other baby had survived...

That baby would've been my sister, but in another body. A little bit of sperm was saved, and she was created. I was the accident. The mistake. I wasnt supposed to be here. 

Why? Why did God choose me? Why was I born? Just to be a ragdoll for people to throw around? Was I just his spare parts? Was I a work of the devil? I dont know...

428,Heartbreak and false truths,"Hi. My name is Jayson, I live in America, and i am 16 years old. 

It always seems like i can never find true love, and also my relationships are falling apart. I can't go to school because of the Corona virus, and im nervous what will happen to me especially since i missed a major test that was supposed to take place back in May, and im African American as well, and the fact that a cop could go ahead and take my life without any reasoning and get away with it is unsettling and im nervous i may end up like George Floyd has. Government says false things again and again and only cares more about the money rather than the people, and likes to brainwash us into thinking that everything is okay even though we have over 3 million in cases and 150 thousand dead just in America alone. 

People playing me for dumb making me believe their lies after fucking me over repeatedly, one person taking money from me and never giving it back to me, and also another person threatening me with violence and her reporting me to the teachers all for her not wanting to wait for me to be ready for a relationship and yet another girl accusing me of sexual assault when i didn't even touch her in any way when i was fourteen, me getting bullied repeatedly from eight to fourteen, me sexualizing girls repeatedly now in the tenth, and two exes telling me that ill never be good enough for anyone else when i was fourteen and sixteen respectively. I try to tell myself that those people that have talked down are me are just mad that they can't get like me, and then i remember im also putting others down to make my self go up. Then that adds to me wanting to commit suicide because i don't want to be doing that. 

Previous school basically didn't care and just shoved bible verses down my throat saying ""you're going to hell if you don't read the bible! Read it everyday and every night!"" And its like, i just want to be helped and not by prayer, because, and i am not trying to disrespect anyone's religion, but without action, praying means nothing.

I have ADHD and i may have a bunch of other things, but my family is way too busy to get the stuff i need for that. I started medication back  when i was 8 only to get off it a year later. Ever since then its been a shit hole. I was being disruptive in class, failing subjects, not turning in homework, and my 7-8 grade teachers didn't make it much better, they were especially bad at teaching me, because i don't believe that they knew how to teach ppl like me. Nor basically any teacher really, which is why i never ask for help. I haven't officially been diagnosed with having anxiety or being bipolar as of yet, but especially considering that i can be frozen for a few seconds up to at least a few minutes or more, and the fact i go from happy to sad, to amazed and chill to amped up and angry, im not really surprised if i do. However, ever since i have gotten a case manager since ninth grade, i have been able to be way better with my stuff the two years ive been in highschool, then all of middle school and the last four years of elementary school combined.

And another factor of me being suicidal was back in 2013 and 2016 when my cousins were born. That caused a really deep scar in the relationship between my uncle's gf's family and my family, which their family  they try to make excuses for their actions they get all mad and there was a huge argument which almost involved the police.

I have attempted suicide at least twice and also used to self harm. In about 2017 or so i tried to strangle myself with an electric cord at least twice, and used to cut myself in that time frame as well. In 2018-2020 i haven't cut that much but i still think about it often. It feels like the last six years, the world has been out to get me  and i cant take it anymore. This stress is way too much for me to handle right now, and ive been having suicidal thoughts for about three years now. It hasn't hit rock bottom again since it did when i was 12 when i almost did kill myself and all, and i mean all of my family was crying. I don't wanna even think about them crying, but at the same time, continuing to live like this wont cut it. Problem is, im not sure now insurance is for a therapist, and a therapist would be way too expensive for me. Plus, im living with my family for at least another two years, so even then, I don't know how i would be able to do it.

And there are more reasons i want to kill myself, but i dont really have any in mind since there are quite a lot. I just feel so overwhelmed and defeated that i dont know if ill make it past 20. Thank you for reading this post.",1
429,I can’t talk to anyone in my life anymore because I can feel them getting annoyed with how depressed I am,"I have one friend who I talk to occasionally outside of my boyfriend who lives with me. They’re the last two people left in my life who I would consider close to me, and I can feel them getting more tired and frustrated with me every day. My depression has gotten to the point where I can’t come off as remotely happy or content for more than a few hours at most. Even when I’m trying really hard to fight how defeated I feel, it’s not long until whoever I’m talking to expresses their frustration with me because I have nothing positive to talk about.

It’s exhausting. And because of this problem, I haven’t talked to old friends or any family members in months outside of an occasional text message. I feel so alone. I feel like I deserve to die because all I do is bring down those around me.

I don’t have anything good happening in my life to talk about with people. I have 2 college degrees, and a over a year out of school I have no job to show for them. I’m overweight. I don’t do anything interesting outside of playing video games, drawing on my iPad, and applying to jobs so I can wake up to rejection emails the next day. So how the fuck am I supposed to answer people every time they ask me “OmG hOw’s Ur QuAraNtIne GoiNg LOL I wAnNa gO GeT A DrInK sO Bad!!” Like, cool Stacey, I’m running out of savings, don’t know how I’m going to cover bills or food next month and I want to fucking die.

I used to want to make people happy so they wouldnt feel like I do but nobody tried to do the same for me and I know I'm not important I am useless I realized that I'm never going to come up with some technological advancements or save the world I'm just some useless kid that's going to kill themselves one day I really just want to feel cared about like I'm not some useless kid I want someone I know compliment on things I do or how I look I want my parents to love me I want to be noticed I want I want I want but it's useless itll just all disappear with me one day as I die but I know it's not gonna happen I've learned from my mistakes why love someone that doesnt love you   why not hurt people that hurt you and even ones that didnt why not hurt everyone so you can take your anger out on something instead of keeping everything to yourself maybe then I'll feel something  I dont know where else to put something like this sorry if I'm just being needy or annoying I dont know what's wrong with me",1
432,I wouldn’t care if I died.,"I’m (16F) not going to go out of my way to make things end up to where I die. I’m not going to kill myself.

I am so overwhelmed with everything happening recently (virus and family issues to sum it up) that if im trying to do a simple task like write something down, and someone talks to me or interacts with me in any way, I immediately become irritated and angry. I’m coping with it as much as I can but my best isn’t doing much. 

I just got great news yesterday and yet this entire feeling is drowning me. I just know that I would finally be at peace if everything were to just stop. If everything were to just come to a halt for even an hour, I would be good for years to come. But thats quite literally impossible.

I don’t want to be here forever. I just can’t think of anywhere I want to be, whatsoever. I am with someone I don’t want to be with, I don’t have family I can move in with, And I can’t afford to move out of my boyfriends house into my own. I have no “safe place” like a moms house to crash at while I get my shit together.

I feel so purposeless. I know that comparison is the thief of joy, and that no one REALLY has it together, but I am struggling to find even one reason why I need to stay on earth. I’m 22 (F), have no real hobbies or passions or interests, just years of compounded trauma that makes it excessively difficult to enjoy things. 

I’m not even sad. I’ve been in this place before. It just feels annoying, or even irritating that I have to continue to live while there’s people who are dying who desperately want to stay earthside.

436,Dark Cloud of Loud,"Hi everyone. I don’t want to be here anymore. I get no joy from life anymore. The other day I asked my boyfriend if he would allow me to kill myself because I’m suffering and in pain but he wouldn’t agree to the plan. I don’t understand. We don’t let animals continue living in pain. We don’t even let some people continue living in physical pain. So why do we just leave people in mental and emotional pain to get on with it? Some of us don’t want to “keep going.” Some of us see no light at the end of the tunnel. I am 23 years old and I have very severe anxiety that mainly revolves around my health. I worry that I have every illness that ever existed. I also worry that anything j do is going to kill me, for example, playing Animal Crossing. I can’t place paths in that game because if I do my head says I’ll die. I know it makes no sense. I have depression. PTSD. I recently found out that I suffered emotional and physical abuse as a child which has lead to me ending my “relationship” with my mother. I now have no members of a family left because they have all been involved in that abuse. I also went on to experience abuse in romantic relationships and am currently being investigated for a personality disorder. I haven’t been able to go to college or university. I don’t even know what it is I want to do with my life. My head constantly feels loud. If it’s not the health anxiety talking it is the voices of various other people in my head who have other interests and ideas. I can’t see what they look like I can only hear them and they all sound like one big mess, talking over each other. Sometimes I can’t even sleep because they are telling me their ideas so loudly and I feel motivated to carry them out. They convince me that I have the skills to do things that I have never even done. I feel like I need to learn to do anything, that I just know how to do it, and then I get disappointed when I realise I can’t. Sometimes I’m convinced that I am a famous singer or that I wrote songs on the radio. I don’t know what’s wrong with me but it’s too loud and too confusing. I also don’t deserve love. I finally found someone who was willing to stick around but I’ve been horrible to him. I have episodes of intense anger and impulse. It feels as though a black cloud comes over me and I have no control over what I say or do. The other day that happened and I threw a bag off my boyfriend and today I have pushed him and called him some horrible names. I don’t want to be here anymore. Life brings me no joy.

439,Stand up straight with your shoulders back,"“To stand up straight with your shoulders back is to accept the terrible responsibility of life, with eyes wide open.

It means adopting the burden of self-conscious vulnerability, and accepting the end of the unconscious paradise of childhood, where finitude and mortality are only dimly comprehended. It means willingly undertaking the sacrifices necessary to generate a productive and meaningful reality”

Now I hate the things that used to make me happy, lifelong passions just poof, no longer something I enjoy. I hate that any grain of self I had was taken away.",1
444,My Life is a Unique Hell,"I don't know where to begin, so I'll try to make bullet points.

  Recent discoveries: 1) During November 2019, I looked back at my life and I realized  that people think I'm retarded(people constantly staring at me, people's attempts at trying to throw me off/make me look stupid, talking to me like I am a little kid, and the fact that it was becoming more apparent that people I've never met would treat me the exact same way that other people would. 2) Within the past few weeks, I self diagnosed myself with either being slow, being mildly autistic or having Asperger's Syndrome. 3) After reading stories, and finding out that being two genders is a thing, I took a look at myself and realized I am transgender (female with male genitalia). 4) Absolutely nobody has respect for me. 5) No matter how much I try, I can't walk properly. 5) I should've never been in middle school or high school.

  Coincidences: 1) Part of my horrendous walk and posture were coincidences. When I first started to walk funny, I would stiffen up certain limbs and other body parts due to social anxiety. 2) Being that I am a tranny, I didn't understand why my pelvis and thighs felt and moved the way they do. The swaying motion made me feel uncomfortable and to a lesser extent, feminine, so I put a halt to my natural movements (pelvis swaying and any other feminine movement.), which resulted in waddling, limping, side to side motions, etc. 3) I was extremely simple and close minded. I grew up with entertainment (entertainment pretty much raised me.). From the time that I was a little kid up until now, I was constantly showered with trips to movie theaters, DVDs, my own TV, at fourteen I was given a smartphone(YouTube, social media, games), and at an early age, I was introduced to video games. With all of these factors, I had a strange outlook on life, and unrealistic expectations. This led me to being gullible, doing not so ordinary things, and saying things that were out of line. 4) Being transgender is the main reason why I'm soft/ I can't fight, why I'm over emotional, why my voice trembles when I am intimidated, why it's hard for me to tell people no, and why I am easily broken (for example: If I ignore someone and they keep ordering me to leave, I'll end up doing it.). 5) I was peer pressured and egged on. When I was younger, I used to be very quiet and shy. I've had my parents, classmates, etc tell me that I should talk to other people (big no no), and that sitting or standing in an area quietly looks weird, when in reality, it's perfectly normal. I ended up being self conscious about sitting and standing, so I'd move my feet, fingers, etc, when this actually made me look more special than I already am. I would approach people I knew along with random people, attempt to put on my best ""being a friendly neighbor"" impression. I would project my voice so that everyone could hear me speaking, because this was my way of showing people that I'm chill and someone you'd want to get to know. I had always thought to myself me and people don't mix, (even if I'm not shy, awkward, and if the person I'm talking to is showing me respect.) and I felt that for me, socializing is unnatural and forced. 5) Being the class clown. I inadvertently made myself look straight up retarded by acting like a class clown. When I was in school I'd always make the people I was with laugh whether it be intentionally or unintentionally, so I took to being the person who makes people laugh. I would make retarded noises, I'd play dumb, answer students questions for the teacher, etc. 6) Being African American and hanging out with stereotypical Black people. Back then, being that I was always told to fit in, and because of me having a follower mentality, I used to refuse to follow orders/make things difficult on purpose, talk with a fake hood or ghetto accent, and I thought that dressing like a thug and making angry facial expressions would make people view me as tough. 7) Realizing I'm a sociopath. I used to like the idea of murder and dismemberment of corpses, my interest in guns increased, etc. In the end, I became a creep because I would openly hint to people that I would do something big (both because I was into murder and because I wanted revenge.). During class I'd look at annoying students and fantasize about how I would kill them. 8) For a while, I went through a phase where it seemed like the world revolved around me. 9) The biggest coincidence  was me selling candy during 10th and 11th grade year of high school. I was always trying expand the amount of customers I had by asking almost the entire school if they wanted to buy candy. Other than this, I'd annoy the hell out of my existing customers by asking them on a weekly basis ""Would you like to buy some candy?""I had a greedy businessman mentality, so I was obsessed with making a certain amount of money every school day. Because of this, I scared away some friends, customers and associates.

  The worst things of all: I lived the majority of my life not knowing that I am transgender and functioning autistic. Being that I recently shed my simple and close mindedness, I am able to see reality with 100% clarity, and I am truly traumatized by the way I used to carry myself. Now, I am pretty much handicapped due to severe social anxiety, severe depression, PTSD, and derealization. No matter what I do, people will always attempt get over on me because they think I'm not all the way there (Lie about the amount of money they owe me, claim that they don't recall what I'm talking about, stealing from me, and trying to nice talk me into giving them stuff like money and food.). I live every single day having to deal with intense reoccurring sad, cringe worthy, and painful memories (mostly memories from middle school and high school). My parents did not think to tell me that I am special even though I've hinted at me being treated badly everywhere I go. It was only after I got in trouble at high school that they decided to mention it. Knowing what I know now, I should've been informed on my special condition and put in online classes years ago. This could've cut the the amount of negative things I had gotten myself into in half.

  The bottom line is that I am a horrible mixture of things: 1) Noticeably ugly. Whenever people walk into an area that I'm located in, they stare in shock, with looks of disgust and anger. 2) I am special. I am pretty much like everyone else except that I am slow when it comes to a few specific things, my voice is robotic, and evidently I can't walk normally no matter how much I fix my posture.3) I am transgender. 4) I am in constant danger because am a target for robbery, bullying and I can't fight.",1

461,Hatred helps me with suicidal thoughts,"I had girlfriend only once when I was 17yo for 3 months, 4 years ago. I have never had sex and struggle to find any female partner. I am very sensitive yet rather confident man (5'6'' for some women doesn't count even as man tho) who needs strong feeling ( L O V E ).

After years of struggling to find partner, relationship, tenderness, kindness that every human being simply deserves I started having suicidal thoughts. Don't get me wrong. My life is not a complete failure, I am doing pretty alright in other areas like friends, hobbies, education and job but I feel years that were supposed to be best years of my life are running away and emptiness without someone close to me who I'd love is really painful.

I've been rejected TOO many times, insulted, bullied (by women I was attracted to) throughout all these years yet I didn't surrender. I didn't transfer my disappointments into sadness but into anger. 

I know it's really harmfull for my mind and people surrounding me but feeling hatred (towards people that constantly make my life worse, towards myself, towards (!) majority of women) is motivating rather than depressing. I can do jogging, work, simply normall activities I wouldn't be able to do whilst feeling deep sadness. I have never felt any desire to be aggresive or to hurt anybody physically or verbally). It's just strong feeling, fuel for my life. Fuel I'd change to love if given chance that no one wants to give. 

You will tell now that ain't no women will want to be with you because of this hatred. Partially it's true. But this is misunderstanding of cause and result thought process. Hatred is just a result. Cause are rejections, being despised etc

 I'd like to point out that hate is that kind of feeling that doesn't come out of nowhere. Out of nowhere you can just don't like somebody.  For something stronger there is need for a greater reason. Hatred is a result of painful experiences over the years I find it really hard to describe them, if someone want I can share few stories on private message.

466,This is my last post on this thread,"Hey everyone,

I’ve posted on this thread a couple times before. I’ve had suicidal ideation for 13 years now. There are a myriad of reasons why I’ve felt that way for a while stemming from being a victim of abuse: mentally, physically, emotionally, and sexually. I also dealt with a pretty neglecting mother who also lied to me about my biological father and didn’t tell me the truth until I was an adult. And this is only scraping the surface.

The main reason why I’ve felt this way though is because I’ve committed some awful, evil, disgusting, and vile sins to people that I loved. This traumatized and hurt people, and it tainted my soul and crushed my spirit. I felt like the scummiest person that has ever walked this earth.

A couple days ago those thoughts were in full bloom and I had intentions of either jumping off a bridge or purchasing a shotgun.

However, despite being engulfed in a full on depressive episode, I was able to take a step back, and re-evaluate the situation. I reached out to my mother and also my best friend and told them everything about my mistakes I made.

After consulting them, I then realized that past mistakes and pain do NOT determine someone’s worth. I somehow was also able to find the silver lining and use these wrong doings as fuel to become the absolute best version of myself possible. And that starts with forgiving myself. Me having true guilt and remorse shows that I’m not a scummy person and that I actually realized that I committed things out of line. I’ve been making a valiant effort to let things go, accept, and forgive myself. Because if I were to keep dwelling on this, I would be haunted by these mistakes forever and will never find happiness.

My thoughts on a typical day includes self sabotage, guilt, killing myself, and uncertainty of the future. It swirls around me nearly every minute, mostly involuntarily. And there were many times that I gave into those thoughts and then a full episode would emerge.

Ever since my episode a couple days ago, I disabled all my social media, and I’m making a conscious effort to rebuddle every single negative thought that comes up with a positive one. Even if I don’t fully believe those positive thoughts yet, I have to start training myself to do so. My theme now is a hard reset. What I need to do now is to completely rewire my old dark thought process. And it’s a lot of work and it’s not easy I’ll say that. But it is possible. I’m going to make damn sure I hold myself accountable to that to the fullest extent, and that I stay consistent on a daily basis on this.

I’ve also realized that taking my own life isn’t going to destroy my pain. It’s only going to transfer to everyone I’ve came in contact with for the rest of their lives. I know this because a close friend of mine took his own life last December and it hurts me everyday til this moment.

For those of you that have read this far in, I love you all. You all are fucking warriors and the fact that you’re still here despite all the hardships you all been through speaks volumes to that. I’m happy to say that since my last episode, I have not looked back on taking my own life. I also have not looked back on my mistakes and I have forgiven myself. Stay blessed everyone. Even if you don’t think anyone cares about you, you would honestly be surprised. Peace and love to everyone 💜",0

485,How to tell everyone who has ever cared about me goodbye,"I’ve been making gifts for people and letters to go along with it. Making sure they know that it was never their fault and they did nothing wrong. I also thanked each and everyone of them being in my life. I’m my parent’s favorite so I need a little help to make sure they feel better about this. My friends are all getting custom made things to ensure they know it wants their fault.

So, maybe there will finally be a peace. Or maybe I will have another chance in another life. I hated myself so much. I shouldn't have been born at all. My whole life has been a mistake. I will fix it now by killing myself. 

This all my fault and I don't blame anybody. And there was no choice. 

Goodbye.",1
487,exhausted constantly thinking about death,"first i wanna say i have no plan or intentions of hurting myself. since my last post here ive felt slightly better, but for the most part i still feel the same.

tldr for my previous posts -- february my partner of 2yrs broke up w/me, we reconnected in may and were friends, then he cut me off again for good in late june. another mutual friend since then has been ignoring me, and im still super close with and talk to 2 people that are also pretty good friends with him.

since this happened, ive pretry much closed in on myself -- completely abandoned posting on all social media except my private twitter account, and ive only stayed in contact with about 5 friends that im extremely close to. some acquaintances have tried to reach out to me but ive been scared to talk to them because im scared my ex friend is spreading rumors about me.

ive been feeling pretty hopeless for so long that im pretty desensitized to feeling that way. i have to constantly keep my mind distracted because if i dont, then ill start thinking about how shitty everything in my life has become and ill start thinking about death and suicidal ideation.

 m constantly anxious when i make plans to hang out with my friends that are also friends with him because ive been paranoid recently that my ex friend is trying to constantly make plans with them so they arent spending time with me (another mutual friend expressed that he implied not liking that his friends are also still friends with me, and that i was spending time with them)

i think about this a lot because even though i know itd make things worse and my family and friends would be sad, i know for a fact it would make my ex-partner-and-friend extremely happy. he called me an abuser to a mutual friend and was bitter/angry. im tired and exhausted and i know itd make him and the other friend rhats ignoring me super happy if i died, i think if i were to die in front of him in real life he would seriously laugh/celebrate.

again, i dont have a plan or intention, and im medicated and doing therapy 2x a week. im trying to take care of myself. but i still really wanna die and im really tired.

thanks for listening if you read all this, i really appreciate it. if you have any advice thats also appreciated, otherwise i just appreciate a lot you reading. thanks.",1

491,Meaningful relationships,"I don't have, or have ever had, a relationship where I felt cherished, understood or respected. My mother and father had me early and split up early when I was little. My mother worked 2 jobs while my father raised someone else's 3 children. The other kids all called him dad which made me very sad. I didn't understand why I had to share my dad. But I soon understood that they were sharing him with me because that was their dad now. As such, I have always felt unwanted. My dad eventually had to be court ordered just to visit me. 

Because my mother worked so much, I was mostly raised by my mentally ill grandmother who was extremely paranoid mistrusting of everyone. Every time I was with her, she pretty much downloaded all her paranoid ideas and mistrust of people into me. As such, I am pretty mistrusting of everyone as well. I generally feel like most people don't like me, have bad intentions when approaching me, and have hidden negative meanings when speaking to me. Because of this outlook I generally just do not like people, and those that I *do* like, I can't open up to at all. I just don't know how to. On top of that, the military has made me very rigid, blunt, and direct when I speak. People think I'm an asshole, and I *am* an asshole, but unintentionally so and I don't know how to fix it. 

I have a thick and heavy blanket of lonliness that weighs me down all the time. It's like a deep fog that I can't see beyond. It's difficult to breath because it's so thick. It makes me feel so unloved. I wish I had a circle of friends or anyone who gave a shit about me, really. I just want to be loved, felt, and understood. I want to combine my soul with other people in a way that feels otherworldly. Like you just get each other. It will never happen though, I've gotten too old, too emotionally hardened, and too busy for that to happen at this point. 

Truthfully, I just hate myself. I fantasize about hanging myself constantly throughout the day.  I hate everything about myself really. I truly feel like I am a disgusting human being. The only reason I haven't done it, is because I'm scared about what I'm going to find on the other side of this thing. And if there is truly nothing, then I feel like I should just ride this thing out as long as I can, but I just don't want to anymore. My desire to live is like a match right before it goes out. It's there but it could easily not be there if the wind blows the wrong way. 

I'm scared of God. I'm not a good person. I have done a lot horrible things. I'm not exaclty scared of him sending me to hell or something, I just don't want the disappointment of an infinitely powerful and eternal being. I mean if God is disappointed in you, then wow, how could anything be worse than that. Imagine coming face to face with God and he wont even look you in the eyes because he's so disappointed. Like he gave you the gift of life and all you did was complain about it, hurt other people in it,  and then you killed yourself. Maybe thats why he sends us to hell, because he can't stand the sight of some of us. I don't blame him. Some of us are trash that should be thrown into the fire.

Too scared to die, too scared to live.",1

495,The. Butterfly,"Besides two sharp objects we're impailed to my core of Spain leaving me with the consequences that the lack of energy and enthusiasm and mind would bit by bit make me break apart cuz I no longer had control over life after being impailed and I'm sure there was a cosmic will under it saying you must diminish from existence ...in the worst way 
Let's not forget the two broken knees by chance again that they also created a different reality for me it's all written on the spirit and the energy body how a critical damage takes everything from you even a alternative reality of hell is waiting for you that you don't know 
And hey 
The butterfly s fly forever now not just these two they were made by other butterfly's from family 
So overall 
Everyone else had a choice but after studying the flaws inside my will caused by surgery the will to act then it was too late , I wish I was never borned , and I didn't wanted to I'm sure I would never want something like this if I were to see things in my early life before I come here I'm sure I wouldn't

496,Why live a life you were forced into?,"Being born is possibly the worst thing to have ever happened. I didn’t ask for this life. I don’t want to live it yet ppl force me to go to interventions and therapy and shit like that where they fill your mind with their own ideal beliefs. It’s pointless. Countless attempts and hospital trips have gotten me no where. An infinite number of different prescriptions that have the same effect but a new name. Years of ppl telling me I matter but when it comes to it, they only say that bc they care abt public appeal. They could care less abt you or what you do. I’m tired of social media making severe mental disorders “cliche”. And they act out for attention when ppl actually suffer. And when they try to come out abt it, ppl don’t believe them bc of public media and generational stereotypes.

I’ve tried to kill myself plenty of times. I tried jumping, to OD, get hit by a car, hanging, nothing seems to work. I only end up in the psych ward with broken bones. I have no will to live. I’ve felt a lifetimes worth of pain and sadness over the past couple of years. There’s nothing left for me to feel.",1

498,Why couldn't I have an acceptable problem?,"People would want to help me if I had been abused. Or if I had a real mental disorder instead of just cyclothymia. But nooooo. I had to be attracted to children.

Children. Every ten posts I see someone saying pedophiles deserve to die. Not people who hurt children. People who are attracted to them. It kinda sucks having to deal with something and NO ONE giving you the benefit of the doubt.

Maybe you'll finally accept me if I kill myself and atoned for the sin of being born. I'm kind of sick of people I DON'T EVEN KNOW shitting all over me IN MY LEISURE TIME. Like come on, this is supposed to be my safe space.

I AM SERIOUSLY GOING TO DO SOMETHING AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT BUT COULD YOU AT LEAST TELL ME I DESERVE TO GO TO HELL OR AT LEAST PRISON SOME OTHER TIME? Thanks. I know you don't care about me AND I DON'T CARE ABOUT ME EITHER.

SO THERE.",1
499,Suicide from an empath's POV,"I have a bunch of stories and memories, but there is one I wish to share. I'm an empath and constantly absorb other peoples emtions, especially depression. I've been living in a dormatory for about a year, when one night I couldn't go to sleep even though I was pretty tired. I was feeling extra depressed and suicidal. I've fallen asleep from depression many times, but this was different, stronger. After laying down for about an hour my adrenaline was activated for no reason, so I sat up and was feeling this increasing urge to cut, to release this stress and anxiety. I got a knife from my drawer and starred at it for about 30 mins. I was looking at the light reflecting off it and dreaming about how good it would feel to just try it out. It was a feeling of attraction and addiction even though I've never tried it. The urge kept increasing and I began to get tunnel vision starring at the knife. It never looked so beautiful in my life. I'm not sure how I resisted the urge to do it, but after a few hours it started to fade away and I went to sleep. Everything else was normal that weekend until Monday came. When I was on my way back to my dorm there were people dressed in hazmat suits working in the room across the hall from me. I asked them what was going on and they told me that the girl who was in that dorm committed suicide over the weekend. I later found out she cut herself and bled to death and I felt all of it that night I couldn't go to sleep. Everything I felt was what she was going through. Her adrenaline activated because of all the cuts. I had been absorbing lots of depression for years, but that night was like nothing before. My perspective changed forever that Monday and I gained a different understanding for suicide. She will never know that I was looking for her. I've never shared this because even I thought my experience was unbelieveable and rediculous. I had talked to a few people that I thought were depressed in an attempt to locate the person I was absorbing, but since she never left her room, I was never able to meet her. But I was really close, I questioned the person who lived right next door to her before that weekend. I've never regret anything in my life, but that Monday, I regret not trying harder. I feel like I can help people 1v1 if I could just talk to them. I'm not interested in helping them or turning them in, I think thats the wrong approach. I want to be their friend. I think curing suicidal people should be a side effect, not the main goal. I'm probably wrong, but I'd like to offer a new perspective. When I'm feeling depressed and suicidal I want someone I can trust and share my experience without consequences. Being an Empath I've decided to walk toward the darkness instead of away from it like most people. I've become attracted to death and depression. What I want more then anything is a close friend to talk about everything with no filter.",1
500,I want to kill myself but can't.,"I want to kill myself. I have wanted to for many years. I've thought about it near daily for my entire adult life and most of my teenage years. I've done some bad shit and I've seen some more fucked shit. Stuff I just can not talk to a therapist about. I tried getting help got on some pills and regular appointments with a therapist but then corna happened and I used it as an excuse to not go back and I've been ignoring their calls. (About 3 times a week i get a voicemail them asking me to get ahold of them) my girlfriend thinks I've called them but I lied. Guilt is constantly eating at me about that and I genuinely want to kill myself. If I had a gun I would have done it by now. I use weed to self medicate but I can no longer afford it because I quit my second job last night and I'm down to just one because i cant take 55+ hour work weeks anymore. I speed constantly when I drive and I wont slow down for any cunts that try and pull out in front of me because I want to get In an accident. I wouldn't cause one but every time someone gets close to hitting me I just get sad they stopped in time. I had a really good paying job about a year and a half ago and things were on the up and up but the boss there was never actually there and was breaking laws that would have gotten me in trouble because I was the manager there when those laws weren't being followed so I had to quit so I wouldn't get in trouble. And things just havent gotten better. Not to get political or anything either but the current election cycle and how our government ""for"" the people just makes me want to end it that much sooner. Might just go out for another nightly drive. Idk why I'm posting this. I read a lot of the recent threads on here and I relate to several of them but none more then the one that said they wished they could have just never existed so that they wouldn't hurt anyone by just not being around anymore... Existence is pain. My debt isnt going away and the economy is trashed.. My girlfriend is asleep in the other room and as much as I want to lay in bed and feel her warmth I'd rather be cold and dying right now.. I wish I could leave and no one ever know. No one else be hurt like I want to be hurt.",1

502,Benefits of lack of sleep,"1 muscle degeneration 
2 lack of energy 
3 .......being able to fall sleep when you are eating lunch with your eyes fully open 
4being able to fall sleep with your eyes open when you swing your head 
5 receiving lots of unwanted sleep shock which lives a permanent damage to the brain and far too many shock s because you can only sleep 3 4 hours a day would lead to brain death ..and eventually a few whilr later death cuz the brain death has far more degeneration left in it when you mix it with time  ...when the night falls .... And the head won't get filled no matter how much you put in it ..inside that pit of despair you find the beauty of death , don't suffer further on 
6 the time for sleep getting shorter as the acid inside your mouth increases , imagine sleep ing for 1 hour for 3 days and it's not that you don't want it sleep but you fail when you try your mind just blinks because the subconshes got used to the idea of sleep shock go to sleep and wake up before you go ...so that's from that too ....where you don't understand what I mean I know after sleeping for 1 hour in 3 days death is the actual solution , it's the solution for this condition",0

504,My rabbit passed away from pneumonia and I don’t know what to do,"I came back from seeing my mom for three days while my dad watched my bunny dank. I saw her head was tilted but just assumed she pulled a muscle because she chases the hellll out of my cats and it annoys them and eventually my cats are like please stop chasing me. So I took a day to observe her and she seemed she was getting better, then the next day she wasn’t eating. I took her to the vet as a fill in and we waited for a long time then left figuring we’ll make an appointment somewhere else tomorrow and actually get in, this vet is always know for being so busy but they are good. I regret not waiting longer. When we came home she was chasing my cats again so I thought she was getting better. I still made an appointment for the next morning at 10:00. The next morning around 7:30 I hear her breathing heavy from in the hallway. She’s laying weird in her toys having labored breathing so I call the vet and tell them and they have me bring her right away. She’s immediately put in an oxygen tank and the doctor told me she had a 50-25% change of living if I can get her to a vet two hours away, fluid is already filling up her lungs. There were two options, leave her in the tank overnight and take her in the morning or take her now only being in the tank for like half an hour and try to get to the other vet. I took that option because at that second I didn’t have the $800 they needed right then and there to have her there over night so I went back home got my stuff and headed to the other vet. I also regret this I should have just gone straight there. About 40 minutes into the drive she started running around in a circle and twitching, she tried to get up on the passenger seat about five minutes before she died and I’m so angry because I didn’t get her and out her I my lap like she wanted because I was driving so fast and didn’t want to reach down. When she couldn’t move much anymore but was still twitching I risked it and got her and out her in my lap, I think she died either when I picked her up or when she got in my lap. I had her in my lap for over an hour dead until I got to the vet. I kept praying to god please don’t take this bunny from me I don’t know what I’ll do. I got her when she was a baby I watched her grow up, she was my protector if strangers came in my house to fix the tv or something she’s attack them and I always felt so safe with her. She’d fuck up a 96lb dog no problem. She loved when I’d get on the ground with her and pet her for hours. She’s literally been the reason I didn’t kill my self while I was in a really abusive relationship, I literally had a gun loaded and put it to my head but I kept thinking about her and how no one could take care of her when I was gone. I have two cats and I know they’ve lived with my dad before and they can again and be fine. But my bunny, she would be lost. I can’t believe she’s gone, when she died she started to get stuff and I kept screaming god please put her life back in there. I remember thinking fuck if she dies I’m going to be a mess and might kill myself. I don’t want to tell any of my friends because I feel like I’m already being annoying because I keep crying. I’m so in denial I’ve been looking at bunnies everywhere trying to find her soul, I so dumb I think she’s going to just pop up somewhere and come back like nothing ever happened. I just want my bunny back life is so hard without her. She was only two my job was to help her grow old like 10, she died too soon I didn’t do my fucking job. I should have taken her to the vet the first day I felt something was off. I hate myself for it and really just feel like I deserve to die because I feel like I let her die. I hope I get pneumonia and die like her so I can know how much pain she was in and suffer like she did. She didn’t deserve to die I did!!!!! Why is she dead instead of me! I even miss her peeing on my couch and bed and chewing holes in my carpet and shitting everywhere. Everyone told me to get rid of her and I never did, I let her free roam around my house and destroy it basically. I wanted her to have a good long nice stress free life, and that didn’t happen because she died at 2 1/2 years old",1
505,Trying to get better,"I have very strong suicidal thoughts, and it takes all my energy to not give up and kill myself. I promise that I will fight these thoughts and negative feelings, and seek as much help as possible, and I try my best everyday to get better and will continue to try.
But if one of these days I can't keep going anymore, if I get so tired that I do something wrong and stupid and take my own life, I just wanted to let something written here, just to be sure that people know I existed, and lived.
I am 28, I like videogames and cookies. I love to read science fiction and fantasy. I have a Bachelor's degree in pilosophy, and a Master's degree in project management. I love to walk, and listen to the rain. My favorite color is pink. When I was 8, I tried to eat dead leaves just to see how they tasted. I traveled to Japan once and it was wonderful, and I got my first tattoo there. I love cats, but I think all animals are cute, and that's why I chose to be vegetarian, because eating meat makes me cry. I try to draw sometimes, but I suck and my drawings are not quite good. I watch a lot of series, and my all times favorite cartoon is Gravity Falls. I have four tattoos : one on the right side of my chest (a kirin), one on my left wrist (今日, which is the japanese for ""Today"", to remember not to postpone what I have to do), one on my left shoulder (an eye), and the last one of the left side of my neck (Kerobero from Cardcaptor Sakura). Each time I feel too bad, I try to get a tattoo, this way I don't mutilate myself. When I was 20, one of my best friends killed himself, and I have always felt guilty for that. I also like to cook. And to kiss. And all kind of things. 

This way, if I can't keep going, and if I do something so stupid like taking my life, there is a proof of my existence, and when people will read this they can remember me even if we haven't met eachother.

I've did everything people told me that I just needed to try out. Guess what: I still want to die. It has gotten worse. I can't stop thinking about dying. I constantly am daydreaming about people being beaten to death. There is no morality. I don't even know what's right or wrong anymore. Any moral system that I try gets ""UHM ACKTUALLY"" 'd by some psudo philosophical idiot nihilist redditor that rules the modern world now. Worst part is that I have no good argument against them. It really is meaningless.

I am just here for no reason and I hate it. It isn't fun. It's scary and I just want to stop getting out of bed anymore. I just get up because I don't know what else to do. I want to jump off a building already.

522,Idk when but I know the day will soon come,"So, after a lot of research online and constantly going back and fourth, I finally made the decision to start making some purchases. This was last week Thursday. I can’t say what they are so I don’t give anyone else any ideas but let’s just say they were all easily accessible through Amazon. Fast forward to today and the items are still in their boxes in my room. I look at them everyday and ask myself ...when? Everyday I tell myself I need to start getting my affairs in order but I don’t even have the motivation to do that. I want to tell my friends how much I love them and how grateful I am for them being there for me and trying to support me but it’s pointless. I literally do not have the will to live anymore. I have spent this entire year literally wallowing in self pity, grievance and heartbreak and it is truly exhausting and I just can’t go on any longer.  It is not fair on them. They will all go on to live such incredible and fruitful lives with or without me. The last thing they need is someone like me burdening them. 

Idk when the day will come but my gut tells me, it will be before the end of this year. The idea of getting through 2021 doesn’t even sound remotely possible in my eyes. I am just so so so tired and I can’t not wait to just rest once and for all.",1

i'm tired of living, but i'm so, so scared of dying.

i'm scared that i'll regret it. scared that maybe change is just around the corner, and that ending it would be throwing away my happy ending.

but maybe it's naive to think that things will ever get better.

534,My first attempt,"My first suicide 
I was at home when I decided to make some weed brownies. I walked up to coles to pick up supplies, came back and started making the brownies. After they’re cooked I decided to put a movie on, sorry to bother you. I let the brownies cool down for a little bit and add frosting. I munch into a slice and settle in, about 30 min into the film I start thinking about something I can’t remember what, then it got me thinking about suicide, I grab a knife and head to the bathroom, I’m really worked up at this point, I keep staring at myself in the mirror just thinking, just end it if it’s not today it’ll just be tomorrow or the next just get it over and done with. Even if you die people will cry but they will move on, nothing you do even matters. I put the knife up to my throat next to my jugular, when I thought I want to feel how it feels first before I do it. I hold the knife up to my arm and just with the weight of the knife I let it slide up and down my arm. The feeling of it was so good, I honestly don’t know how to describe the sensation. All of my worries had left my I just kept staring at my arm, no blood had drawn. I look back up at myself and break down when I realised what I had done. I sit on the toilet just crying head in hands. I then stand back up grab the knife and do it all over again. This time a little deeper, it felt so much better this time, I was out of breath after it. After the adrenaline wore off I broke down again back onto the the seat.My phone gets a notification saying that some gym gear I ordered is on its way, i calmed down a little bit and went and grabbed s cigarette and had one there in the bathroom.",1

flash forward three years later and Im a miserable empty mess that fills my depression with alcohol and weed. I really don't like where my life is heading and I really dont want to do the 9-5 thing.

The thing is I have nothing to be upset about besides my wight I have a loving family, i have many many supportive friends, i live comfortably and im going to one of the top schools in my state for historical studies. I just feel empty, i feel like i want to die because i dont feel fulfilled and this feeling grows every time something bad happens to me. But id be leaving so much behind and upsetting many many people.

I have roughly 7 grand in the bank and will sell my stuff and will probably have about 15 grand by the time i sell everything.

I failed to get a job in US  and cannot stay here anymore (I need to leave the country because of legal reasons now) and there are no jobs in my own country.

I have friends and family who care but I feel like I can't talk to them. I'm scared to voice my problems because I don't want to end up in a mental hospital again. I literally sleep until it's time for work, deal with that bullshit then come home. I barely leave my house. Even for groceries, I'll usually just order delivery so I don't have to see that many people. I feel like everyone is judging me. Like they know I'm a piece of shit. The smallest problem will set me off. You'll probably laugh when you hear what led me to this post. I was supposed to drop off a stool sample from my kitten at the vets today. They were open from 730am-6pm. I slept until 5:20pm and when I woke up, I barely had enough time to get there. So I was looking for my hat to cover my bed head. I couldn't find it. I'm looking and looking, now I'm losing patience. I'm tearing through my belonging, less patience. Now I'm yelling, throwing shit around, making a giant mess. By the time I find this hat, it's too late to make it to the vets, I'm in tears and want to die instead. Over a fucking hat!!! This is almost every day. Something stupid. Clearly I'm depressed and have anxiety but I don't want people to think I'm a baby. I hate living. It feels like more of a job then my job. I want to die all the time but I'm too much of a pussy to do it myself because the thought of dying sends me into a panic. I'm impulsive but I know I'll probably never kill myself. And it scares me to think I'll have to go on living like this for another 30,40,50 years. It seems like it's getting worse as I get older. I'm 29. I've accomplished nothing. I work a shit job and spend all my time playing video games. I'm assuming for the false sense of accomplishment. I don't know. I just really needed to vent. I'm afraid to tell my family this stuff because I don't want to burden them and I definitely don't want to spend any time in the hospital. I just don't know what to do.

549,27 Club,"Have you ever asked yourself if you're too fucked up to ever get 'un-fucked'? Well, to me, it's a daily topic of conversation that I have with God... Truth, The Source, call it what you will, it's all the same anyway, and how you address It will never matter. I'm 25 years old and i have been for about a month or so. In this time, I've decided to join the 27 club. What does that mean? Well, in my case, it's a steadfast decision to YEET myself from this mortal shell I refer to as 'myself' in about 2 years time. What will I do until then? The question remains. What I will try to do is nothing short of epic, but nothing close to immortal, sadly... What I'm basically trying to say is, I've had enough of the shit and I've had enough of not having enough power to change any of it. Sure, I can work on myself and focus on my field of vision, yet I still can't make a step without tripping on some shit someone else threw out without thinking... I wish I could remember the very moment I agreed to this life, but I can't. I can't remember anything since before I was 3. I can't remember you, I can't remember me. All I want is to be free, not knowing what it means to be. See? Coincidentally I've tried as much as I've cried, and it's been liters-no, gallons-no, metric fucktons of tears, hiding from fears, switching gears and trying to live as true as I can, but what can I do, I'm just a man..? A struggle, however subtle will present itself, but all I see is double, so how can I choose the right way to lose? Is there a way to win, like this? Has it always been? A kiss, to go from trough to crest, man, fuck the rest, I'm only willing to settle for the very best. Though you can't reach the top, if you decide to stop. So my message to you is, don't listen to me, mind your own biz; don't fear yourself, that's where the truth is.   


I just wanted to share this rant with someone, anyone...  
I'm not suicidal, I'm just manic... So sometimes I panic.  
We're all looking for some kind of validation, be it from brother, sister, or some causation.  
Remember to be strong, this world without you, would be just wrong.

I just hate it. I hate how my life is nothing but and endless loop of miserable and pathetic decisions that i made so far. My family is just shit , they might show some love but fuck i feel like they only show it because of how pathetic i am . I dont have friends and i struggle to be social.

A giant ball of black nothingness. That will be the earth in the future whether you like it or not.

No one understands either, they think I’m just “having a bad day” but I’ve been “having a bad day” for years. I know this won’t pass because it’s gone on for so long and I can’t talk to the one or two people who actually might care a bit because of Covid-19

554,Life is so tiring,"My daughter just turned one, but more and more I've been feeling so distant from everyone for no reason. I sometimes look at her and just dont emotionally recognize her as anything but a baby. I dont feel a connection with her anymore other than sometimes gushing over how cute she is. my bf/baby daddy is the same for me. he and I have been together for about 7 years now. 

We've had ups and downs but I haven't cared for him much since I caught him texting and exchanging nudes with other girls. I stayed with him and forgave him but he did it again two weeks later, again caught him, again forgave him, and he hasnt done it since (as far as I know). 

I used to love him to the ends of the earth, left my family and religion that I deeply cared about to be with him, but now I only stay with him because it would be a hassle to break up and I dont have the means to live by myself and my baby.

I changed too. I was doing so good with routine and hardwork before and during my pregnancy but after the birth and moving in with him, I've become lazy and despondent. my confidence is practically gone. I have no friends anymore though I used to have many. I've gained weight and have stretch marks everywhere.

My mother in law that I live with keeps spreading lies about me, that I dont feed my daughter, that I dont take care of her, and has threatened to call social services so she can adopt my daughter. this isnt true though, all I do at home is take care of my daughter. She's known by the family to be extremely abusive, manipulative and to be a pathological liar, but no one outside the family knows this.

Lately a lot of people online and around me have been joking about rape and argue that most women are liars when it comes to this and I've just been trying not to show it but it triggers some unwanted memories and I get nauseous and stressed everytime I hear about it.

I just want to die. That's all. I know my mom would take great care of my baby since accourding to my mother-in-law I'm not enough, and maybe that's true.

557,Failed attempt.,"I tried to kms the other night. I let my cousin know cuz we have always talked about doing it and I wanted her to come get my kids in the morning. Well she rang the police and now my arms are messed up for nothing. 
Family are having my kids for a week or so because I haven't ever been completely child-free for 15yrs.
I had considered doing it while they were away because that's the ideal time to do it, but I've been trying to hold on. Had a call off social services an hour ago and they are questioning my ability to have my children. The police woman who was here the other night was a condescending cow and just smirked at me the whole time and she had made the report sound way worse than what it was. My cousin never should have called the police. Now I'm in a worse position than before. Now I'm sat here in tears, meds at the ready, but I need to see my children one last time. I can't video call them cuz the family members they are with will know something is up and stop me. Thinking about writing them letters but if I do that, I still don't get to see them. I need to hug them. I feel terrible for leaving them, but I hate life so much and SS crawling over me is just one more thing I can't handle. My kids were the only things I got out of bed for. I'm a good mum. I get up every day even when I just want to lie in bed and waste away. I look after them and get them to all their appointments. My kids are the only things that kept me here, and even sometimes that doesn't feel like it's enough. I'm actually fighting with myself whether or not to do it. I was drunk the other night but I'm sober now and the feeling is overwhelming. I'm going to have a potter round and a tidy up, and wait for a sign. I dunno what sign in looking for. Something good to happen to make me decide to stick around, or something bad to just push me past tipping point. If you've read this far, thank you. I just really needed to tell someone how I feel, safe in the knowledge that they aren't going to call the police or other family members on me.

His best friend died and not soon after his girlfriend ended things with him. This girl was his first girlfriend from what I know and she moved from out of state to be with him. Apparently, she broke up with him because she felt like she couldn't help him after the death of his friend. About 2 weeks after this he committed suicide by overdose, which failed so not a year later he tried again and failed again. I've tried so much to try and figure out why Ben is so set on death to no prevail. 

Ben says life is pointless, he can't stop grieving about his past pain. He told me how the world is a horrible place. He made it sound like everyone is greedy and we all just act oblivious to the real problems in the world for our own self-gain. 

This dude is really suffering and I want to break his awful way of thinking. 

He does have some serious issues though. When he was 16 he developed a food allergy after the overdose. He can't eat any of the foods he used to and he told me that it's definitely a contributing factor to thinking living isn't worth it. 

Living isn't worth it.....He says there's too much pain in the world. everything is temporary even happiness but pain sticks with a person. 

I hope you guys understand how serious this is and how deep he is in this depressive state.

someone, please give me some advice I don't want to see him die... 

Personally I've experienced a lot of pain and overcame it so I thought I could help of course...seems like there's a lot more I should know

Also, he has been to a mental hospital before. He told me he felt like he didn't belong there. There were people with schizo and psychos. he thinks he didn't belong there...

Ben has also been to therapy which he initially resented but it never ended up helping him

&#x200B;

please drop any questions, my thoughts were kind of jumbled throughout this, any words of advice are greatly appreciated",0
563,Lost all my friends,"Just found out my mom was sexually 'explicit' with me as a kid. Still creepy to this day. My best friends left me, nobody is willing to help me deal with this. Someone in my head keeps taking my body over and fucking my life up. The voices tell me they're fake and that I just make up every single problem I have, for attention. My life is collapsing. I'm thinking of killing myself. Not telling anyone this time, because they'll all think it's fake since it's happened before (4 attempts so far, none serious because I was a coward). 
I just wanted a therapist which my parents won't get me. They blame it all on the phone. I'm a lonely fuck.

566,so fucking tired,"no one helps me. i feel like im drowning and everyone is just watching instead of trying to help. i legit eat one meal a day because of the lack of food. my boyfriend supports me but he doesnt get paid enough and when theres nothing to eat his brothers or mom get him food but nothing for me! lol! he has to lie to them so i can eat. i ask my dad for help but he never has any money even tho he makes 30 an hour.

 i cant find a fucking job because my cars starter is done and we have no money to fix it! legit yesterday i called for help and my brother just whined about his gf dumping him because he cares more abt heroin than her while im stuck in 90 degree weather, unable to get home. 

i had to wait 5 fucking hours until my boyfriends mom picked us up because no one in my family will help. my mom wont help. she has over 100k in the bank and anytime i ask her for help she lies and asks me ""why wont your boyfriends mom help? why cant your dad help? i dont have money get a job go to the food pantry"" 

if he breaks up with me im done. ill have to stay in a homeless shelter. i put up with him blowing up at me over stupid shit like fucking up in a video game or leaving something in the car. one time i told him i felt like a mooch and he started screaming at me saying i was a mooch and i needed to help coz he was tired of me mooching off of him and his brothers. i got him to stop after i said ""youre right. im a mooch and a fuck up who doesnt deserve to live. you can have all my stuff.""

i dont know what to do. im sick and tired. i think i have covid because im so sick that i coughed until my throat was raw and my voice is so hoarse that i sound like a guy. my chest hurts and i have a fever. his brothers go to parties every weekend and bring people over. at this point i hope i have it so i can fucking die. 

ive accepted it at this point. why should i live? what value do i add? i have no life skills from years of abuse and i have no talent or anything valuable to add to society. people tell me im smart but what the fuck am i supposed to do with that? go to college? with what money? im so close to ending it. im only here because of my cat. when she dies so will i.",1
567,Nowhere left to turn.,"I’m 27 years old and live in the US. I’ve been with my SO for 8 years this month, and apart from her I don’t really know if anything would have kept me alive this long. I dropped out of college when I was 20, after having to work long hours with two jobs and fighting a constant battle with anxiety and depression, thinking maybe I just needed a break from the stress, but after the past 7 years of working low wage jobs, living check to check and constantly under threat of being homeless, I realized in a dream last night that it probably was my only chance to do any better for myself.  I’ve made mistakes like anyone else, but have always been able to somehow recover to make more. Things weren’t going so well financially before this pandemic, but we were making due. We both lost our jobs, and were living off the stimulus for the short while it lasted, and fell behind on many bills, the most important of which being a month and a half’s worth of rent, and a couple worth of electricity. Luckily they passed a mandate not allowing eviction, which expires this month. When they prematurely opened everything back up, my SO got a new job, but I’ve had no such luck and have been trying to use DoorDash to make ends meet, but as anyone who has worked a gig will tell you, it alone doesn’t suffice, and beyond that, our vehicle is 26 years old, and hardly wants to start anymore. I just dropped over $700 into keeping it running last month instead of catching up on those bills, so we could continue working. My electricity almost got cut last week, but I managed to find a payment plan to buy us another two weeks. Then the eviction notices started coming. We live in a low end apartment, and I’m sure they’ve had this goal in mind for awhile now and are delighted at the green light to take everything left from us that we haven’t pawned...I’m only out a couple thousand, which may not seem like much to many of you, but it’s literally our entire lives hanging in the balance now. I don’t know what to do. I feel so weak, and like I’ve failed her even more than myself, and although she understands and is one of the most loving people I’ve ever met, I feel like I’m just dragging her down at this point. Even if I were to get a good job today, it would be too late. I have no credit so loans aren’t even close to an option. At first I held out hope for a second stimulus, but anyone will tell you here that you can’t depend on the government for much of anything, let alone actually helping people when they need it. Our elected officials would just call me weak or pathetic if they had the chance, as they like the denounce anyone unlucky enough to be poor. That I’m not working hard enough, or that I’m just a scumbag, a failure. It’s not worth letting that get to me, but this is easily the lowest point of my life. I don’t want to leave her all alone, but I think maybe if I was out of the picture, her family might at least take her in. Mine is worthless, and couldn’t help even if they wanted to, but I don’t want to think about that right now. I’ve been crying in this parking lot all morning, hoping to make $5 or $7 here and there with dashing, while she’s working her ass off to impress her new job. I can’t take it anymore, I’ve got no one left to talk to, and am finally realizing that this time, there won’t be some miracle to save us, we’ve been lucky enough to make it this far. I don’t know how I’m going to do it, but I want to die in a way that I can just disappear, to cause the least amount of emotional pain possible to her. Maybe I can convince her I’m a piece of shit so it won’t hurt as much. I don’t even have a gun anymore, pawned it a couple months ago, and have no idea where to even start. Was hoping I would just get sick and die from lack of healthcare, but I guess working so hard has made me pretty hardy so that doesn’t seem like it’s coming. Not even sure what the point of writing this is, and I know I’m not alone in this disparity, but I’m at the end of the line. I can’t keep composed when I hear her cry, I know there’s nothing I can do but listen. But this is it folks. I hope some of you make it past whatever brought you here, it’s not always fun, but keep fighting til the end. At least I can say I fucking tried...but I give up. I’m sorry.",1

574,"Drowning in debt, suicide is my only option","Hello,

So I don't really know where to start. I live in Europe, I am 24 years old and I am drowning in debt, I think killing myself is the only solution to escape this mess. 

I had a girlfriend for five years. We were engaged and two years ago I found out she was cheating and we broke up. This really affected me. I had attempted to kill myself at the time unsuccessfully. 

Because of the pain of this breakup, and to try to get her back, I signed up for credit cards to buy her gifts. Obviously, this did not work. I also traveled a lot to forget, stayed in nice hotels, going to strip clubs, it was like a millionaire's lifestyle for 18 months. 

Now, I have a job, but I'm not very well paid and I'm drowning in debt and don't know what to do. I work 80 hours a week, leaving me no time for relaxing or personal stuff and all my money goes for food, rent and repayment of my credit cards, I literally don't have a cent for any extras and I regularly have to skip meals. 

I will be done repaying in 7 years, which means I will already be over 30 years old and will have to start all over again. If I decide to buy my own place, I will be signing up for 25 years of debt, basically chaining me until I'm old. 

Seeing this loan balance and getting those calls for debt collectors generates a lot of anxiety, I can't sleep at night and I am not as good at work. They started to micromanage me and I feel there is a risk they will let me go quite soon. 

If I lose my job, I will end up homeless, if I don't lose my job, my life will suck for at least 7 years. I honestly don't think it's worth it and I want to kill myself right now. I live on quite a high floor, I'm thinking about drinking some alcohol so that I'm numb enough to jump.

I realized today that every single day, I contemplate suicide at least once. I’ve never gotten close to attempting, and the thought of it really scares me, I don’t WANT to. But I do. Does that make any sense?? 

I don’t know what to do either, I don’t trust medication. I’ve never been on it and I hope I never have to. I have seven suicides in my family and every single one of them were in medication and getting treatments and committed suicide after going through treatments. So for some reason that scares me away from it. I don’t know what else to do. I don’t socialize much. When I do, I feel kind of empty. All of my friendships are all very surface level relationships.

581,life,"You turn 14, you've started to mature ever so slightly. You start feeling an unexplainable loneliness, you become moody, you distance yourself from your friends because you don't feel comfortable being yourself around them and don't want to open up about your feelings. Then you realize that your loneliness is due to the fact that you don't have any close knit relationships, no one to call a real friend whom you can be yourself around. All you have are people you've catered your personality to so that you'd fit in and not be outcast. You become even more depressed.   


You decide not to get help for this because you're young and stupid, and so you tell no one. You can't make new friends because you're socially awkward and very anxious to be around strangers, so these surface level friends will do for now. 5 years later nothing's changed, you're still putting up with a façade in order to fit in. You become exhausted, you start growing apathetic. You drop out because you've lived your whole life being someone else, unable to make friends because you were to scared to be yourself. At this point you want to kill yourself because the depression has become so ingrained into your personality that even attempts at making new friends whilst being yourself is going to result in rejection due to your low energy and apathetic nature. You're nothing but a burden, to others and to yourself.   


2 more years pass, you've done nothing productive since you dropped out. You've not experienced any form of social interaction, you've lived inside your own head and been forced to suffer through the same thoughts and feelings stuck on loop. You've had plenty of mental breakdowns, you question whether or not you're even sane anymore. Apathy is no longer state of mind you'd trickle in and out of during your depression, you've now become indifference incarnate. You've no wants, no needs. Everything is trivial. Loneliness is no longer so bad, because your emotional quotient is so busted you're no longer capable of hurt.   


You're dead. You're alive. What's the difference? The difference at this point is just the fact that you're forced awake most of the time which is exhausting and monotonous, and you'd much rather be asleep because it's peaceful and serene. So I think I'll go to sleep now, forever.",1

I've known a girl for 2 years straight, she was the best talker and she gave me guidelines in life too.

She was honestly fun being around.

But she was shy, so we never really met.

We knew we were real people, 

since i've met her through one of my friends who were in class with eachother at some point.

&#x200B;

My dad died last year a suicidal approach.

I honestly respected him, and moved on from this.

This wasn't my breaking point.

I wanted to make something out of life and get up to his wishes.

Then i've met someone really nice, and we hitted off immediately.

She was into the same music style, same studies.

And she smelled really nice, it was an amazing time.

&#x200B;

She broke up with me 2 months later,

Because she heard rumors about my past.

And i don't really like talking about the past. 

Not that i did anything too bad.

But, when you're into a weird fetish, and someone discovered that on your laptop.

Words get around, and it's easily just bad karma altogether.

Even more rumors get out some that aren't true at all.

It's just stupid...

&#x200B;

2 months in the later relationship, I noticed strange behaviour in her.

And when she finally, broke up with me. 

I discovered that she was visiting someone else during our relationship..

This broke my heart, and it just didn't really know where to go.

&#x200B;

So then i had already severe socializing issues and a bunch of other things kinda like a sort of PTSD.

If you'd like to know.

&#x200B;

Last month, somebody new came into my life.

Since my mother wanted to be with somebody else.

I usually didn't mind it at all.

She can be with whoever she wants.

&#x200B;

But when she brought in this new ""dad"" figure.

We immediately didn't click. 

And apparently we never will, my older brother has left home due to him.

And my younger brother goes to his friends more than anything to leave the house.

Because it's already beyond broken.

And my grandpa just likes to poke around in business he has no moral high ground over.

&#x200B;

I told the girl that i knew for 2 years everything.

And i just wanted to move on from that aswell.

I loved her, for being so honest, transparent.

And well, forgiving in nature. Because i have to admit,

I sometimes did have a tendency of lashing out on different subjects such as the spiritual and life, quantum shit.

But everything was alright in the end.

&#x200B;

Fast forward a bit, I bought her flowers.

Because that's just how i am, i wanted to break the ice.

With flowers and a card, with my feelings on top of that.

I did had her adress, in case of an emergency.

&#x200B;

I did kinda use it selfishly, i'd have to admit that too.

I'm honest, friendly and mostly just a nice guy.

But whenever i do something ""bad"". 

It just gets worse to where i don't even know a solution any longer.

&#x200B;

In her case, she found the flowers to creepy as f-. 

She was angry, and told me to f- right off. 

So she blocked me, and i..

I just don't know what to do at this point in life any longer.

&#x200B;

I just don't have any emotions anymore, all the things i liked to do are just there.

I don't do them, i had enough off it all.

And i've been dwindling around this fate, for a week now.

I do have people to talk to, it's just not the same.

And i tried to give the relationship my all, but it didn't work.

&#x200B;

I've done an overdosis, a couple of days ago.

But i failed, luckily i didn't get found out. 

I'm aiming to die in all of this.

584,How to go on when all seems hopeless?,"I've recently started thinking about the futility of it all for me. I have one major overarching problem, which impacts every aspect of my life, and has kept me from doing basically anything. 

I sweat. I sweat a lot. Over my whole body. I can hardly function because no matter what I do, I'm always feeling hot, extremely uncomfortable (both from the shame of sweating, and just feeling so hot) and sweating through multiple layers of clothes when I do anything besides sit behind my desk. 

I have been to the doctor with this problem, and was diagnosed with Hyperhidrosis, but no treatment option worked out for me. The only medication which did something to stop the sweating gave me insufferable dry mouth and headaches. 

Due to sweating this profusely, I have never had a job. Never had a girlfriend. Was never able to have the student life all my friends are having. Never able to follow my passions, which are mainly physical and outdoor oriented (very much impossible nowadays). Never able to travel to all the exotic places I'd love to visit. I am just barely crawling my way through my Bachelor's degree, which I'm due to finish next month. 

For something that must seem so trivial to most, sweating is my main focus. It is constantly on my mind. My whole life is centered around sweating. Constantly am I having to not do things I really want to do, because I'll just be sweating buckets, especially in the hellish summer months.

Now I wonder, how can I possibly manage to keep struggling, when all seems so hopeless? I'll never be able to enjoy my life like this, being so constantly uncomfortable. I cannot imagine being able to maintain any romantic relationship, due to the inactivity that is enforced upon me by this horrible condition. How will I ever be able to hold down a decent job, when Id just be sweating and sweating in the office? How will I ever be able to be a fun dad to my children, should I ever have them, when I cannot do activities with them?

There's no risk of me killing myself anytime soon, since my mom recently passed and I couldn't possibly do that to my family, but sometimes I feel like that fate is inescapable for me, and suicide is something I have to face at some point, when life becomes truly unlivable. 

Any advice would be much appreciated.",1

586,How tell to someone suicidal that I'm not available to help her anymore,"Sorry for the pour english. I'm not a native.  


I listen the struggle of someone suicidal for over around 7 year now.I don't have any strength anymore. I want to cut the relationship.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The person is really suicidal, it's not just empty treats, she already do a few attempt. We live in the same street.  


The fact is, I don't like the person at-all. I start helping her out of obligation and because for some reason I'm the only one in her circle who know what to say to someone suicidal. (her family said stuff like ""you don't have the gut to do it , or ""there is people who have less than you who are still happy""). So I start listening to her by obligation, and am stuck in it now.

Over the years, dispite my patient listening,  gentle advices , warning of danger , This person trash various aspect of her life; basicly her job, her financial stability, her heath, and her relationship with other ( it's not just ""cutting the bridge"". It's things like black listing and restriction order )

Currently her situation is really desperate. No job, debt, no money, no friends nor family, in an abusive and violent relationship, unable to work for the rest of her life because of her health.. Yet she continue her destructive pattern.   
She is actually in an inextricable situation which she is partialy responsable. 

The only positive things which I accomplich with her was making  her continue to see her shrink. Who is very bad and unhelpfull, but the only one she accept to see because she don't want to take public transportation to see one.

&#x200B;

for her deserve, she didn't had an easy life at all. She suffer more than all of us reuinited. A lot of bad parenting and badly managed mental health and abusive relationship.  It's fuck up a lot of her life (by example she wasn't allowed to follow an usefull for work scholarship, and had marry in an abusive mariage in order to escape her parent).

But also some stuff  (harrassing a client so badly she lose her job, buying thing she can't afford to throwing them just after, not following some (free) physical therapy to recover after one of her TS, refusing to gain some money she was entitled to because the bank will take half of it to pay one of her debt) are on  her own

&#x200B;

If I don't answer to her in the 10 min she harass me at work and become verbally abusive.

All of that make me grow to dispite her. Which I have never expressed, because half the time I meet her she is on the verge of suicidal because of the consequence of her last crap.

&#x200B;

I've follow the whole guide of how to listening and what to say to someone depressed/suicidal, but the whole ""don't get mad if they don't try to fix their life "" is hard when you can witness them trashing their life then coming back to cry on your shoulder or become abusif if your are not available

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Also my own social circle which I explain my issue with her things that I'm an awfull person because I didn't succeed to help her getting back on her fit ( There is some sort of pressure on my country for women to be able to do as good as a professional psychotherapist for free)

&#x200B;

 I don't have the strength to help her or support this person anymore.   
If it was a standard toxic relationship I would stop it here. But the combo suicidal + desperate situation make me hesitate.

&#x200B;

Another issue : we live in the same street, so I would have to move out ( which I will do this year anyway), but stopping every relationship with  her will either be a very slow process , or a ""I don't want you to call me ever again "" then disapear.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

How can I announce her than I'm moving? (there is never a good moment for that. She is alway crisis under crisis)

How can I stop relationship with her without making her kill herself?  
How can I forbid her to call me every day once I have move out ( I'm under the impression she will make a TS if I blacklist her)",0

I still feel like crap because of what happened last night/early this morning. specially because of the doctor.

I just feel that I'll never call anyone again when it's tough and when I'm on my way to take my life. 
it feels the way you're bothering them when you get there or bother the people you call. I've been there many times already since last year.

Nothing is helping.

No medications help.
I tried chat rooms and other lines. 
I try to watch stuff, clean and cook some food. 
Being in the hospital doesn't work.
Talking to the consolour or the nurses doesn't work.

Everything is shit. life is shit. it's meaningless and pointless and I'm worthless and doesn't deserve to be here.

I've been thinking and planning about doing it on Saturday night. as the doctor said.. if someone wants to take their life they don't call for help.. right? 

I'm having too many thoughts. I don't know what to do anymore or where to go because nothing is working and I only see myself gone in the future.",1

Things have been so confusing. Even my mom said of her own accord, ""your needs are too severe for your life to be safe."" She also conceded she doesn't think the help I need is out there.   


I don't understand why everyone has always said I can't or shouldn't kill myself. I hate myself, and I hate myself for others. I am weak and unworthy, and I can't fix things. It feels even worse when I see the things I know about life being reflected in society, so I know I'm not making up some victim narrative. My mom says I'm too negative. She indicates I choose to be unhappy. She tells me all these things that I didn't think I experienced, but if I tell her she's wrong, she just says again she's right. I think this is gaslighting, but I'm so stupid that I have to consider that she might be right. So why should someone who is so easily confused be allowed to live anymore....",1

601,Just got back from rehab and actually thought it helped,"i got back from rehab like a month ago and i was striving.

Im 18 and planning/budgeting my life for when i move out and begin to ""live"". 

I was so so so excited until i realized, my life hasnt changed. Whether or not i am using coke or fucking random girls or dropping friends randomly, i am still in the same world. My life is boring as fuck and the more i am home, the more stuff that makes my life fun i am losing.

I make music and about a day ago, my harddrive crashed and i lost all of my 500+ music projects. Projects i have had since my 8th grade all gone. My spotify got hacked while i was in rehab and i lost some of the most important music of my life. Ofcourse i still remember some of the songs but i lost playlists with 1,000+ songs. Before i went to rehab, that was the stuff that kept me from ending it all.

602,Does it even fucking matter?,"I'm getting tired. I'm only 20.
The only reason I'm still alive is to keep from destroying my family and forcing my mother into a deeper depression, the fear of God or an afterlife are more. I don't think I've been through much. I've had an easy life, but I don't think I belong here. Existence was forced upon me, I know, it was forced on all of us, but I don't think I can just accept an unwanted gift.
I'm barely a person. I have no identity. Everything I indulge in leads me to either anxiety or dissatisfaction. I derive no pleasure from anything.

I have plans to see a therapist, maybe as a last resort, but honestly it seems like a scam. Paying someone to be my friend because my real friends are tired of my complaining.

I don't know. Suicide has become a constant backdrop of my life since I was 16.

My college friends ignore my messages when I try to connect with them and nobody really messages me first. I'm always the one who does. I'm not even an afterthought to them. Family has been no help either because they criticize what I'm feeling that it's just me overreacting. I don't feel happiness with pursuing the things I love to do anymore.

610,I've started planning and now I finally feel at peace,"I don't have an exact date, but I'm going to get my mail-in ballot for the election, then go, probably sometime in October. My vote will probably mean nothing with the way things are going, but it's still one of the very few things I'm staying alive for.

I'm currently quarantining with my parents, and talked them into letting me go back to my apartment across the country. I love them, but I don't want them to find my body, and it'll be too hard to do it under their noses. Plus, being back home means I can spend my last few weeks being useful and protesting, without fear of infecting them. 

Method is pills and a bottle of whiskey. I'll splurge and make it a good bottle, not like money will be worth anything in a year anyway. I'm going in my bed, in my apartment, the place where I got to be an independent adult for a precious year of borrowed time before the nation collapses. I'm closing the door and leaving a note for my roommate to call 911 so she doesn't have to see me, either. Neither she nor my other roommate like me much, so it shouldn't be too much of a problem. They might even get free sympathy rent and thank me.

Right now, it's just the errands stage. Trying to prepare my friends and parents for life without me. Trying to prepare them to stock up and be prepared for how fast the nation will fall. Writing letters and notes for everyone. Re-homing my cat. It's only the last one that gives me any hesitation, because I do love him, and I adopted him before I realized things were hopeless. But I'm not going to subject myself to slow starvation as civilization collapses because of a cat. I'll try to pick a family of preppers that can take good care of him. My only frustration is that I'll ultimately end up dying a virgin, so I'm going to try and find a partner to alleviate that in the meanwhile, but I don't want to put the moral burden of being my last first time in retrospect on anyone I actually like, and quite frankly I hate even the idea of casual sex and am quite ugly. But I'll give it a go. Quarantine won't matter if I'm going in a few weeks anyway.

617,Feeling like this world is here to be destroyed.,"Hey...

Im.. a boy, 16. I am listening to dark piano while writing this. It just gives me nice vibes. Its 2 am for me. Im sitting in my room with an opened window. The cold wind touching my unperfect body. I don't know what I should appreciate about life. Lets say most of the things that happened to me where not so cool. 2 times I fell in love I got played. My dad wanted to kill himself because of me. He fell in depression. My dad being drunk for many years. I come from Romania so yeah its kinda normal to get beaten there. I cried daily when I was a kid. My Mom left us to go work in another country. After years we moved to that country together. I dont really have friends in real life. Well we talk and call ourselves friends but we never really hangout. I had problems with my legs and couldn't walk, we didnt have the money but luckily my parents found a doctor that did everything for free. If not I wouldn't have been able to walk anymore. I support many kids at my school with their problems, even internet people but never really get help back. I am also religious and I believe in God. Most of the times praying made my life better. So why am I writing this. Well I use the Internet to escape the world. Gaming and Apps etc. are really helping me out. One of them is tiktok which is really getting filled with political stuff. BLM and feminism. I dont get this world. Instead of fighting for equality we are fighting to be better than others. Why arent we saying ALM instead of BLM I mean its still the same, it includes everything. For me Black lives dont matter because there is no Race in my eyes. ""Yes but blm cause more Black People are being abused by the police."" Well yes but you surely dont say Black Criminals either. Feminism is the next thing, we are fighting for equality... NO, remember all this shit with ""KAM2020(KillAllMen)"" and ""what if we stop making babies so the man will die out"". Even religion, cause you know I am religious, why do we have to proof that our religion is the best, just let people live their fucking life. Why instead of being united and having a happy life together, we fight against each other. The world really makes no sense to me. I am a coder and my dream is to open my company. Ill give myself time for it. But if my dream is being destroyed then I guess there is no more point of living in this world. A happy man is just a depressed person, who fakes being happy.",0

624,"Please, help me.","I've been depressed for as long as I can remember. The earliest dream I can remember, I died in a car accident. I fantasized the dream would come true. I was ten years old and I wanted to die. 

After my parents divorced, my Mom fell madly in love  with a man named Vick. My Dad hated him. He would call me every night and make me tell Vick terrible things. Like that he had a fat round head. Or that he was too short for my Mom. I was eight years old. I was convinced I was helping my parents get back together. 

One particular night I must have said something that really rattled Vick. He yelled at me. Tears nearly spilled over. He shot himself in the head that night. Perhaps that's why Mom hated me so much. She didn't need to make it so obvious. I already knew. It was my fault. 

 One year later, my father killed himself. He over dosed on pain pills and beer. It was ruled an accident. But  I knew my father.

In Jr. High my best friend tried to commit suicide in the girls bathroom across from the councelors office. She was gay, in a time before the pride movement had caught traction for gay rights. She was spit on in the halls. Made to feel less than. And though the teachers saw, watched her get pushed into walls and have objects thrown at her, they did nothing. 

When she didn't show up in the locker room, my heart sank. I knew exactly what was happening.  She wanted to show that school what a piece of shit it was. I called the cops. They found her, exactly where I said she would be. Bleeding from both wrists, and with a half empty pill bottle of narcotics. She suffered from brain damage after that. I had failed yet another person. 

By this time my Mom was remarried to my step Dad Bob. Gradually over time we had gotten to the point that merely looking at each other would start an argument. Sometimes it was me. Frustrated at always fighting. Sometimes it was her. Likely that she still blamed me for Vicks death. 

One day she told me that I caused her and Bob to fight so much they had nearly gotten a divorce. Another set of lives I had ruined. And just like that, my days were numbered. She vowed that the second I turned 18 I would be out on my own. Of course, she couldn't wait that long. I spent my last year of high school living alone in an apartment. I worked as much as my job would allow. Barely making ends meet with my minimum wage job. 

Eventually my finances caught up with me. Mom had cut me off from their insurance. Said she couldn't afford to have me on it even though she had to of had the family plan since my brothers were on it. I couldnt afford the insurance, let alone my 200 dollar preventative inhaler. Or my 80 dollar rescue inhaler. Within a year I had succumbed to 60,000 dollars of medical debt. Flying in and out of emergency rooms just so I could keep breathing. My Mom made no offer to help me. No offer to put me back on her insurance. The most she did was pay for my rent once or twice. Just to keep me out of her house. 

During all of this, I was dating a boy named Steven. At first, things started out great. Finally, someone that loved me. Who cared about me. I was wrong. 

It started slow, but eventually he convinced me I didn't need to see my friends anymore. If I did try to see them, he would tell me that I should just never see him again. Because obviously I didn't love him enough to stay that particular day. He was the only one that loved me. I couldnt loose him.

 From there it only escalated.  He would beat me. Tell me I was worthless. Make me into his human play thing. He would strive to embarrass me in front of his friends. One day he turned on a hose full force and shoved it inside of me. He laughed when I nearly passed out from the pain. Much of it was even worse than this.  

One day, though I don't remember why, Steven started yelling at me. He told me how worthless I am. How my family hated me. How my friends never wanted to see me because I was a sorry sack of shit.  How I ruined lives. Everything. Every painful moment leading up to this came rushing back to me in an instant. Suddenly I felt all of the pain from every single moment of my life. Suddenly, my wrist was bleeding. Without even realizing it I had grabbed the knife from the table and slit my wrist. 

I was in shock. My mind completely blank. I could barely feel it as Steven slapped my face over and over again calling me a stupid cunt. All I could see was that there wasn't enough blood. Steven called my parents. When Mom saw me, she acted as if it were all for show. ""What would you have done if it had been deeper?"" Like it had been for attention. 

The only happy time in my life that I can remember is my husband Erik. He showed me what it was like to have someone really care about you. To really love you. And his family, I had never known what support looked like. When the twins came along, it was like I had reached paradise. They were the most beautiful little souls I had ever seen.

Now, my kids are six years old and my husband only has two years of school left. Only two more years od working the job I hate so much. But its like I'm broken. Damaged goods. It's like all of the years of pain and heartache have left me scared and crippled. Over the past six years my depression has not only returned, but its like its engulfed my being. 

I can feel myself failing my husband and my children in nearly every way. It's like I can no longer find the motivation to do even the simplest of things like brushing my teeth. Let alone cleaning. My house is a wreck. If you walked into it you would wonder what homeless person was squatting here. I can't even do the bare minimum for my children. I can barely get out of bed. I only sleep every other day. And worst of all, every time I close my eyes I see blood. Blood sliding down my wrist in the most beautiful way. It's almost like craving a cigarette, to make the pain of the day go away. I can feel the veins in my wrist throbbing. Its almost like their begging me to get on with it. To take the pain away. 

Every time I always find a way to stop myself. I remember how I never understood when my Dad died. I realize that my kids would never understand either. I realize it would hurt them. The smallest of rationalities to hold on for them. But its all I think about. Nearly every second of every day. How I would never have to hurt again. How my kids would be better off with any other Mom but me.. And I don't know what to do. Please, tell me what to do. Tell me how to stop failing my family all over again. Tell me how to stop this pain.",1

anyway to the point sorry...

is it better for them (2 kids and wife) if they know it was suicide or is it better just to smash my car into a wall at 120km/ph...

im leaning towards the car...as it will make payout by the insurers more likely and they may guess but not know for sure which i think would be more beneficial for the kids to get over. the wife could even say it was an accident and they don't need to know.

the only reason an overdose seem better would be the comfort but then 120 into a wall wouldn't last long...

I have had a councilor for about 3 years and tomorrow I have a phone meeting with her again. 

To sum things up, over the past week I have done alot of sole seeking and I have made a realization that at some time in the near future I am going to get out of this world, it just is not for me. 

I want to get out of here before I get sick and get a disease that will eventually kill me.

Now here is my problem,  I have always been honest with my therapist. I dont know if I should be honest and tell her of my struggles that lead me to this decision or if I should just say everything over the past week has been normal and no changes are noted.

I would love to be honest and let her know I have arrived at this solution and its not that I want to KMS cus I am unstable, but rather I want to KMS cus the pain of living is worse then the pain of KMS. Also I am not going to do it tomorrow, not even this week (atleast I dont plan to as of rn) and prob not next week ether. But it is possible if the pain is too bad next week I will do it then. But I have alot of things to take care of first so its unlikely to be next week ether. 

I have done extensive research on methods, and I have found one that is suitable. 

My question is what kind of things should I avoid saying in order to avoid getting sectioned? For example I know if I say ""I want to kms and I have a method picked, and I have obtained the supplies I need to carry it out, and I am going to do it soon"" in that case I know they would prob try to section me which I dont want. 

So I was wondering what I should avoid saying? for example if I said I picked out a method and have researched materials I need and I have a way to obtain them easily but I have not purchased them yet, would that statement incriminate myself too much to possibly get myself sectioned? 

any advise would be much appreciated",1
635,People became mad at me for the trauma I put them through by my suicide attempt. does that make any sense?,It was like I should feel bad for THEM because I was so distrought and tried to end it all.  So I ended up apologizing and just feeling worse about myself.  It solidified the notion that no one cares and it doesn't matter if I go or not.,1
636,I want to die.,"Well i might had thought like this since i'm 15, now im hitting 20. I also tried to go to therapy but well i was there a few times but never commited to a session. I cant feel any happienes anymore. Just like short periods. I cant talk to any of my friends neither i'm sure if anyone even likes me as a friend. Noone ever writes me nor talk to me when we meet up in a group. And i really dont want to slide into a drug addiction. I startet consuming weed and well its one of the only things holding me up, holding my dark thoughts away every night... i dont want to consume it every day so i feel really suicidal again..
And every body i tell sth about my problem is like ""its a phase"" ""you ll find happines"" or not even lisening or thinking i'm just joking...",1
637,Heck if I know,"I don't know why I'm still alive, I wish I never existed tbh all this shit isn't worth it. At this point I'm pretty much just waiting to die, at least then I won't get called a pussy for killing myself.",1

639,I'm so ambivalent about life this time.,"There's no heartache and release. I just am not valuable to these so-called loved ones. I do not appreciate my own value. I can feel the hatred from my sister. A torn relationship that neither of us can mend but that she seeks to make permanent with endless blame.. it hurts. My father is old and is infantilizing himself for love or whatever. I do care for him but I don't care about him. He's not forgiven.

&#x200B;

Yep. But that's just whatever.

&#x200B;

I have nothing and no-one to fight for. An 18 yr old girl just made a complete long look of disgust at me. so like....this world....I have no duty I care for. Life will go on. And I wanna know what this whole death thing is about...I'm clearly too lazy for life.",1
640,Back and Forth with Suicidal Thoughts,"Hi,

&#x200B;

Every year I feel like I go through such an intensive phase where I want to die. It's exhausting, no one ever checks up on me and the one person who made me feel okay (my childhood best friend) rarely texts me. The one person who would make me feel valid and worth living is the same person that promises to stay and leaves me to fight for myself.

&#x200B;

I understand that he is under no obligation to babysit me and I don't want that, I just want to feel like people take in what I say, not some comedic relief.

&#x200B;

Note: I have never went to a psychologist, I attempted to go to a GP Doctor and he started smiling when I told him about how I feel and I felt stupid after that, I would talk to counsellors as well and they spewed the same ""painting helps"" bullshit, the same tired faces with a forced smile.

&#x200B;

I know no one **has** to do things I want them to do but it'd be a nice change to hear someone genuinely say ""How are you?""

&#x200B;

I honestly don't know what I'm going to get out of this but I just felt like I needed to let this out.",1
641,"I’m sure I just need to get it all out and talk about it, but I don’t think I’m gonna make it to 19","Im a male who just turned 18 in April and I’ve been sad on and off for a few years but this is the first time I actually wanted to kill myself. Early this year my girlfriend of 2 years broke up with me out of no where, we were totally fine one day, (she was even bringing up marriage)
And the next thing I knew she left and blocked me on everything. But that’s not the part that I’m worried about, I’m a fifth year senior and the school said that they may have to let some students go and I’m scared I won’t graduate. I’ve made kind of a promise that I’ll keep going for as long as I can if I graduate, but my parents said that they’d kick me out if I don’t graduate  so if I don’t I’ve been thinks big of just giving up and ending the whole ordeal. I’m sure my thinking will pass eventually but I’m scared that it won’t.",1
642,Life just feels flat,I am a 32 year old father of a 9 month old and my wife has just threatened divorce again. We were supposed to go out to a wine tasting and they aren't doing tastings anymore cause of the covid and somehow the whole day is ruined and it is my fault. I feel like no matter what I do o cant feel anything for anyone. I feel so alone and just cold. I would kill for a friend but I feel like I dont deserve it anymore. Even my daughter doesnt make me feel how she shouldi just feel so dead inside,1
